  <h1><font color="red">Hello World</font></h1>
  <p>The font inline is moved so it becomes a child of the h1 element.</p>
  <h1><span color="red">Hello World</span></h1>
  <p>The span inline is not moved so it becomes a child of the h1 element, which is inconsistent and does not correspond with current browser behaviour any more.</p>
