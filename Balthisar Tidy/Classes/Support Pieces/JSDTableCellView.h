/**
 *  Simple NSTableCellView subclass that's just generic enough to handle a couple of cases:
 *
 *  - Default NSTextCell Handling
 *  - Handle a single NSPopUpButton
 *  - Handle an NSTextCell with an associated NSStepper
 *
 *  Also takes steps at instantiation to ensure that appearance is consistent with my
 *  expectations:
 *
 *  - PopUps are only visible when hovered.
 *  - Steppers are only visible when hovered.
 *
 *  Finally it observes NSUserDefaults in order to change its hover effect.
