<h1>Presenting Balthisar Tidy for Work</h1>
<p>This is an advertisement. It’s fairly unobtrusive and hidden in a help file,
and so we at <strong>balthisar.com</strong> don’t feel too guilty for plugging a paid
product: <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>.</p>

<h2 id="heres-the-intellectual-incentive">Here’s The Intellectual Incentive</h2>
<p><em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> gives you all of the great features of <em>Balthisar
Tidy</em> with a few extra goodies to make it worth it:</p>

 the colors used to syntax highlight your code. Even better you can assign
 these color combinations to custom themes and change them at will. Several
 attractive themes are already included in <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Side-by-Side Browser Preview with Optional Scroll Locking</strong></dt>
  <dd>With <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> you can observe the Browser Preview for both
the <strong>Source HTML</strong> and <strong>Tidy HTML</strong> side-by-side at the same time to ensure
that the work Tidy performed did not change how your document renders.</dd>
  <dt><strong>AppleScript Support</strong></dt>
  <dd>Leverage the automation that AppleScript enables and introduce <em>Balthisar
Tidy for Work</em> into your complex projects.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Export Tidy’d Output as Rich Text</strong></dt>
  <dd>If you’re working in an environment with code reviews or management reports
you might want to have a syntax colored version of your HTML available for
use. <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> can output its Tidy’d text into an RTF file.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Export and Import Command Line Configuration Files</strong></dt>
  <dd><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> has a great UI, but sometimes you need to use command line
Tidy as part of your workflow. Why not let <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> help you

ready-to-use configuration for command line Tidy?

  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Top Secret, In-Development Features</strong></dt>
  <dd>We’ve got a lot more planned for <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>. Get your copy
from the
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/balthisar-tidy-for-work/id899115421?mt=12">App Store</a>,
now, before the price goes up.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="and-heres-the-emotional-appeal">And Here’s the Emotional Appeal</h2>
<p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> and <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> are fun products to work on, and
fun and pride in craftsmanship is really our chief motivation at
<strong>balthisar.com</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Our primary motivation to charge for <em>Balthisar Tidy For Work</em> is to
pay for language localization.</strong></p>

<p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is free and always will be (in fact, it’s free and open
source). Sure, some of the development tools cost money and distribution in the
App Store requires a yearly, paid membership, but these are relatively low costs
that contribute to our enjoyment. But language localization is expensive, much
too expensive to eat out of pocket.</p>

<p>So, here’s the deal: 100% of the net proceeds from <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>
will be used to pay for language localizations, prioritized by the number of
sales in each language region.</p>

<p>And, hey, if you already speak English and don’t care about the Latvians, then
consider purchasing <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> on its merits alone.</p>
