<h1>Use the Nu Validator Outside of Balthisar Tidy</h1>

<p>Although <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> defaults to using the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu">W3C Nu Validator service</a>,
it also includes a local copy of the this service. When configured in the
<a href="#/topic-prefs-prefs-validator" title="Validator">Validator Preferences</a>, <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> will use its own
version of the Nu Validator.</p>

<p>As long as <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is running while properly configured, you can access this
server from a browser, or automate the validation of several documents with a
shell script or AppleScript.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-built-in-server">Starting the Built-in Server</h2>

<p>From the <a href="#/topic-prefs-prefs-validator" title="Validator">Validator Preferences</a>, select the option <strong>Use
<em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s built-in validator service</strong>, and choose an appropriate, open
port. When configured properly, the Validator Preferences will look something
like this:</p>

<p><figure>
  <img src="/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/slices/all-tidy-prefs-Validator-builtin.png" alt="Preferences Configured to Use Built-In Validator" srcset="/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/slices/all-tidy-prefs-Validator-builtin.png 1x, /Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/slices/all-tidy-prefs-Validator-builtin@2x.png 2x" />
</figure></p>

<p>The green bubble indicates that the validator is working on the address and
port shown immediately after it. The example <code>http://bigmac.local:8888</code> reflects
my own computer hostname; yours will be different unless you’ve chosen the
same hostname as I have.</p>

<p class="tip">If the bubble is yellow, then the validator is starting up. As it’s written in
Java, it can be a bit slow. If the bubble is red, then something is wrong; you
can read the bubble’s hint text for an explanation.</p>

<p>You can visit the server and submit documents to it via your web browser at the
address shown in Validator Preferences, and it will look similar to this:</p>

</figure></p>

<h2 id="using-the-server-in-the-browser">Using the Server in the Browser</h2>

<p>Within the browser, the pop-up menu is used to select the source of the document
to validate. You can specify an Address (including addresses on your local
network as well as addressed you have access to on the internet), or choose
to upload a file, or type (or paste) into an HTML text field.</p>

<p>This is hardly more convenient than validating from within <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>, though!</p>

<h2 id="using-the-server-from-terminal">Using the Server from Terminal</h2>

<p>Using <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> and writing a script in <code>bash</code>, you could validate
multiple documents in an automated fashion very, very quickly.</p>

<p>The Nu Validator has both POST and GET API’s. If you would like to write such
an automated solution, then <a href="https://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html">consult the API documentation</a> to get started.</p>
