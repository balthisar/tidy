<h1>What is Balthisar Tidy?</h1>
<p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> isn’t just an HTML pretty-printer; it promises to make sure
your HTML is clean, error-free, and accessible. But it’s also much, much more.
<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is an <em>HTML development tool</em>; it can be a <em>learning tool</em>;
it’s a <em>diagnostic tool</em>; it’s a <em>batch processing tool</em>; it’s a graphical
<em>feature discovery tool</em>. And, of course, it’s an <em>HTML pretty-printer</em>.</p>

<p>How can you leverage <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> in each of these roles?</p>

<h2 id="html-development-tool">HTML Development Tool</h2>
<p>Whether you’re hand-crafting your HTML in <em>vim</em>, using a static site generator
such as <em>middleman</em>, or using a commercial package such as <em>Dreamweaver</em>, 
<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> fits into your development chain prior to deployment. It will check
compliance to standards, accessibility, and capture common errors. Tidy will
normalize whitespace, sort attributes, ensure proper declarations, and detect
logic errors.</p>

<p>As a tool in your development chain, <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is perfect for adding those
finishing touches that ensure compliance to your standards prior to deploying
your code.</p>

<h2 id="learning-tool">Learning Tool</h2>
<p>All developers know it: code quality is just as important as the ability of the
code to function. When learning to write XML or HTML, consider using <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>
as a teaching aid. Its instant feedback will reinforce rules, style, and syntax
that all good developers adhere to.</p>

<h2 id="diagnostic-tool">Diagnostic Tool</h2>
<p>“Tidy” doesn’t merely imply code formatting; it also means helping you eliminate
bad stuff. Things like errors, logical inconsistencies, and deprecated language
and syntax. <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> gives you a much needed sanity check before you
ship.</p>

<h2 id="feature-discovery-tool">Feature Discovery Tool</h2>
<p>Tidy has a long history in the command line world. It also has dozens of option
settings and inconsistent descriptions of what they do. Trial and error in the
command line world can be a frustrating experience.</p>

<p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em>, though, offers all of Tidy’s options in an efficient, easy-to-use
GUI that provides instant Tidy’ing and instant feedback. If you don’t have the
patience to read dry specifications, simply use <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> to discover the
features that you want.</p>

<h2 id="batch-processing-tool">Batch Processing Tool</h2>
<p>Command line Tidy can be used in shell scripts, and using <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> as a
feature discovery tool makes it easy to decide on the settings that you want to
use with command line Tidy.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky enough to have <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>, then you also have the
ability to generate a configuration file for command line Tidy directly from
<em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>.</p>

<p>Finally as a <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> user, you appreciate the better things in
life and can skip shell scripts altogether. AppleScript support enables
high-level scripting, automation, and interoperability with other Macintosh
applications. With AppleScript you can batch process entire folder hierarchies,
or even use Folder Actions in Finder to Tidy files automatically.</p>

<h2 id="w3c-nu-validator">W3C Nu Validator</h2>
<p>Document validation is a requirement for many developers, and <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> can
address that requirement using the defacto World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Nu HTML Checker. You’re not limited to <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s fast, built-in version,
either. You can validate online within <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> with the W3C’s service, or
choose the compatible service of your choice.</p>

<h2 id="html-pretty-printer">HTML Pretty-Printer</h2>
<p>And of course, <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> provides the same pretty-printing features that
Tidy has been known for for years.</p>
