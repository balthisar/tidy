<h1>The Source HTML Area</h1>

<p>The <strong>Source HTML</strong> panel is where you see and (if wanted) edit the
original file. When you open a file, its text will be present in this panel.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can <a href="#/topic-how_doc-doc-create" title="Create a New Document">create a blank document</a> and begin adding
HTML markup in this area directly.</p>

<p>It’s often convenient to make quick-and-dirty, valid HTML documents
by typing directly into this window without opening documents, and <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is
a good choice for becoming your favorite, light-weight HTML editor.</p>

<h2 id="drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</h2>

<p>You can drag and drop files from Finder, as well as blocks of text from other
applications, into the Source HTML panel.</p>

<p>Note that when dragging files into the Source HTML pane, you are <em>not</em> opening
that file. You are merely copying the contents of that file into the current
document.</p>

<p>Eligible file types for dragging are slightly different depending on the version
of macOS that you are using.</p>

<h3 id="file-types">File Types</h3>

<p>When dragging files into the Source HTML panel, you should expect that
<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is going to try its very best to add the contents of the
file to you document, in whatever textual format that it can. Even some image
files can be added (in their textual form), which is probably not what you
expect.</p>

<p>Files whose contents cannot be added will paste in the filename, instead.</p>

<h2 id="transpose">Transpose</h2>

<p>If you are using <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> as your editor, you will likely want to update the
<strong>Source HTML</strong> panel with the result of the <strong>Tidy HTML</strong> panel from time to
time.</p>

</figure></p>

<p>To do so, choose <strong>Transpose Tidy to Source</strong> main menu’s <strong>Edit</strong> menu, or use
the shortcut key as indicated.</p>

<p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> will try its best to preserve the location of your insertion point so
that you can continue typing immediately, however certain changes – especially
if there are many of them – will affect this position.</p>
