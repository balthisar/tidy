        <p>This is an advertisement. It’s fairly unobtrusive and hidden in a help file,
        and so we at <strong>balthisar.com</strong> don’t feel too guilty for plugging a paid
        product: <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>.</p>
        
        <h2 id="heres-the-intellectual-incentive">Here’s The Intellectual Incentive</h2>
        <p><em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> gives you all of the great features of <em>Balthisar
        Tidy</em> with a few extra goodies to make it worth it:</p>
        
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>AppleScript support</strong></dt>
          <dd>Leverage the automation that AppleScript enables and introduce <em>Balthisar
        Tidy for Work</em> into your complex projects.</dd>
          <dt><strong>Generate Command Line Configuration Files</strong></dt>
          <dd><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> has a great UI, but sometimes you need to use command line
        Tidy as part of your workflow. Why not let <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> help you
        by using its superb GUI to develop your settings, and exporting them into a
        ready-to-use configuration for command line Tidy?</dd>
          <dt><strong>Top Secret, In-Development Features</strong></dt>
          <dd>We’ve got a lot more planned for <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>. Get your copy
        from the
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/balthisar-tidy-for-work/id899115421?mt=12">App Store</a>,
        now, before the price goes up.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <h2 id="and-heres-the-emotional-appeal">And Here’s the Emotional Appeal</h2>
        <p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> and <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> are fun products to work on, and
        fun and pride in craftsmanship is really our chief motivation at
        <strong>balthisar.com</strong>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Our primary motivation to charge for <em>Balthisar Tidy For Work</em> is to
        pay for language localization.</strong></p>
        
        <p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is free and always will be (in fact, it’s free and open
        source). Sure, some of the development tools cost money and distribution in the
        App Store requires a yearly, paid membership, but these are relatively low costs
        that contribute to our enjoyment. But language localization is expensive, much
        too expensive to eat out of pocket.</p>
        
        <p>So, here’s the deal: 100% of the net proceeds from <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>
        will be used to pay for language localizations, prioritized by the number of
        sales in each language region.</p>
        
        <p>And, hey, if you already speak English and don’t care about the Latvians, then
        consider purchasing <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> on its merits alone.</p>
