          <p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> and <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> incorporate work created by others
          and it would have been much more difficult (or even impossible) to bring these
          products to you without their help.</p>

          <p>This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231</p>
          
          <p>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
          This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
          be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is
          now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the
          license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is
          the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free
          Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
          under the Open Source Definition.</p>
