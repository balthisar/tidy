          <p>The <strong>Source HTML</strong> panel is where you see and (if wanted) edit the
          original file. When you open a file, its text will be present in this panel.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="source html" src="../../assets/images/docpart-source.png" /></p>
          
          <p>Alternatively you can <a title="Create a New Document" href="../../howto/doc/doc-create.html">create a blank document</a> and begin adding
          HTML markup in this area directly.</p>
          
          <p>It’s often convenient to make quick-and-dirty, valid HTML documents
          by typing directly into this window without opening documents. We don’t
          recommend making this your primary HTML document editor, however, as
          there are many full-featured editors more adequate for working with text.</p>
          
          <h2 id="drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</h2>
          
          <p>You can drag and drop files from Finder, as well as blocks of text from other
          applications, into the Source HTML panel.</p>
          
          <p>Note that when dragging files into the Source HTML pane, you are <em>not</em> opening
          that file. You are merely copying the contents of that file into the current
          document.</p>
          
          <p>Eligible file types for dragging are slightly different depending on the version
          of Mac OS X that you are using.</p>
          
          <h3 id="mac-os-x-1010-yosemite-and-above">Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and above</h3>
          
          <p>When dragging files into the Source HTML panel, you should expect that
          <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is going to try its very best to add the contents of the
          file to you document, in whatever textual format that it can. Even some image
          files can be added (in their textual form), which is probably not what you
          expect.</p>
          
          <p>Files whose contents cannot be added will paste in the filename, instead.</p>
          
          <h3 id="mac-os-x-109-mavericks-and-below">Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and below</h3>
          
          <p>Generally only the contents of text files that are in UTF character encoding
          will have their contents dropped into the Source HTML panel.</p>
          
          <p>Files whose contents cannot be added will paste in the filename, instead.</p>
