<h1>Tidy’s Tidy Options Pane</h1>
<p>
	<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> Tidy’s the text according to a broad set of
	options which are found in the ”Tidy Options” pane.

			Tidy offers several options for cleaning HTML, correcting errors, identifying
			accessibility issues, and more.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you select any of the Tidy options, a description of that option appears at
			the bottom of the Tidy Options panel.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don’t care to see the description for any of the options, you can hide
			it completely using the show and hide button at the bottom left hand side of
			the list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, at the bottom of the options panel is an action button with several
			choices that can help you work more effectively with Tidy’s options.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Reset options to defaults in Preferences…</strong></dt>
			<dd>
				This action is available in Tidy document windows, and when used
				it will change all of the Tidy options in the current document back
				to the settings that are stored in Preferences. This may be helpful
				if you’ve been making many options changes and simply want to revert
				back to the defaults.
			</dd>

			<dt><strong>Save these option settings to Preferences…</strong></dt>
			<dd>
				This action is available in Tidy document windows, and when used
				it will set the Tidy options in Preferences for you. This may be
				helpful when you’ve been making many options changes in pursuit
				of the “perfect settings.” Once you’re happy with the results, you
				can store them in Preferences very, very easily.
			</dd>

			<dt><strong>Reset options to factory defaults…</strong></dt>
			<dd>
				This action is available in the Tidy Preferences window, and will
				restore all of the Preferences options settings back to whatever
				the factory default values happened to be. You may want to use this
				option in order to return to a clean slate after experimenting with
				features.
			</dd>

			<dt><strong>Show friendly option names</strong></dt>
			<dd>
				This action is available in Tidy document windows and in the Tidy
				preferences window. Normally <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> displays the
				Unix Tidy option names so that experienced Tidy users can identify
				their favorite options right away. When friendly names are enabled,
				<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> shows more human-friendly names for the 
				options. This is particularly useful if you’re using a non-English
				version of <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> because the Unix names are
				English only.
