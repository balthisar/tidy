<p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is used around the world, so why not help us make it available
in <em>your</em> native language?</p>

<p>Those of us at <strong>balthisar.com</strong> speak a couple of languages in addition to
English, but the quality isn’t nearly enough for our high standards for quality
software.</p>

<p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is completely free of charge, and <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>’s
primary purpose is to earn money for professional translation, but with a niche
product like <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> you can imagine that the volumes won’t support
more than a single language, or perhaps two. So what can you do, if you’re so
inclined?</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> is primarily intended as an
avenue for pursuing funding for language localization. While we‘re happy to
swallow the costs of distributing <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> free of charge, language

<p>Priority for translations goes by <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>’s sales volumes in
each language reason, so convince your friends to buy, too.</p>
