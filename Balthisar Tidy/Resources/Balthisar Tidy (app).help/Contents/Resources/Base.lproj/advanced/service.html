          <p>Balthisar Tidy offers one or more Mac OS X System Services, depending on
          your version of Mac OS X.</p>
          
          <dl>
            <dt><strong>Tidy selection in new Balthisar Tidy document</strong></dt>
            <dd>This Service starts <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> (if it’s not already started) and
          creates a new, untitled document with the selected text.
          
              <p>This Service is available on all versions of Mac OS X on which
          <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> runs.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Tidy selection with Balthisar Tidy</strong></dt>
            <dd>Using the <strong>Preferences</strong> from <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>, this service will
          perform Tidying in place. You don’t even have to start Balthisar Tidy to
          use it. Note that this service will always produce a full HTML document, ignoring
          the <code>show-body-only</code> setting in <strong>Preferences</strong>.
          
              <p class="note">Because of Apple's sandbox security system, this System Service is only
          available on Mac OS X 10.9 and above.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Tidy selection with Balthisar Tidy (body only)</strong></dt>
            <dd>Using the <strong>Preferences</strong> from <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>, this service will
          perform Tidying in place. You don’t even have to start Balthisar Tidy to
          use it. This service is convenient for tidying snippets of code without producing
          a complete HTML document.
          
              <p>Note that <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> has no idea of your file’s original indentation;
          <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> will return indented text (if configured to do so), but its
          base indentation will be zero. You may have to use your application’s block indent
          feature once your text is tidy'd.</p>
          
              <p class="note">Because of Apple's sandbox security system, this System Service is only
          available on Mac OS X 10.9 and above.</p>

          <h2 id="how-to-use-system-services">How to Use System Services</h2>
          
          <p>When <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s Services are enabled (see below), they can be used
          from nearly any Mac OS X application. Simply select the text that you would like
          to use the service on, and then use the <strong>Application</strong> menu (for example, in
          <em>BBEdit</em>, the Application menu is called <strong>BBEdit</strong>), <strong>Services</strong> submenu. The
          list of apple Services will appear in the menu, as shown here:</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Services Menu Sample" src="../assets/images/menu-services.png" /></p>
          
          <p>If <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s Services do not appear, then you will have to set
          them up first.</p>
          
          <h2 id="setting-up-system-services">Setting up System Services</h2>
          
          <p>It’s important to start <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> at least one time before setting
          up Services. This allows Mac OS X to know that <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is able to
          provide Services.</p>
          
          <p>You configure <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s Services in the <strong>System Preferences</strong>
          application using the <strong>Keyboard</strong> control panel as highlighted below.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="System Preferences" src="../assets/images/setup-preferences.png" /></p>
          
          <p>Alternatively you can use the <strong>Services Preferences…</strong> shortcut in an
          application services menu as illustrated in the previous section.</p>
          
          <p>In <strong>System Preferences</strong>, <strong>Keyboard</strong> control panel, <strong>Shortcuts</strong> pane,
          <strong>Services</strong> item in the list, you can see all of the installed Services and
          enable them with the corresponding check box, as shown here.</p>
