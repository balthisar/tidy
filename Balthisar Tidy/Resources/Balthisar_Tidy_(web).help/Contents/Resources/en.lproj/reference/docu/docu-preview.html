<h1>The Browser Preview Panel</h1>

<p>The <strong>Browser Preview</strong> panel is where you can review how <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s changes
affect how your source code is rendered. You can see how the browser renders
your Source HTML or the Tidy HTML, giving you a good opportunity to compare
them.</p>

</figure></p>

<p>Present on the bottom of the <strong>Browser Preview</strong> panel are an action menu as
well as a label indicating which HTML source code is currently displayed. Use
the Action menu to do any of the following:</p>

  <dt><strong>Set base URL for external assets…</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Most web pages load external assets such as cascading style sheets or images,
and these are often loaded with a relative URL path. If your document counts
on relative paths to external assets, you can use this menu command to choose
the base URL for such assets.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Clear base URL for external assets</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use this menu command if you no longer wish to load external assets from the
directory you’ve chosen.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Show Source HTML</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This menu command will show the text in the <strong>Source HTML</strong> panel in the
<strong>Browser Preview</strong>. This can be useful if you suspect that Tidy is changing
how your page is rendering.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Show Tidy HTML</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>By default <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> displays the result of the <strong>Tidy HTML</strong>
panel in the <strong>Browser Preview</strong>. If you have changed to another view, then
this menu command will return to the default.</p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="browser-preview-throttle">Browser Preview Throttle</h2>

<p>The Browser Preview is very, very fast, and it will keep up with your typing in
the <strong>Source HTML</strong> panel even for very large documents. This makes
<em>Balthisar Tidy</em> a very good standalone HTML editor in its own right.
However some complex documents, especially those that load a lot of external
resources, can cause the <strong>Browser Preview</strong> to behave sluggishly (after all,
it tries to update after every keystroke).</p>

<p>If you experience such issues, consider adjusting the <strong>Browser Preview
Throttle</strong> setting on the <strong>Advanced</strong> page of <strong>Preferences</strong>. This setting
can ensure that the <strong>Browser Preview</strong> <em>won’t</em> update instantly with every
keystroke, but at a more moderate frequency.</p>
