<h1>The W3C Validator Table</h1>

<p>The <strong>W3C Validator</strong> table indicates the validation status of either your
original source document or the Tidy’d version of the document. Similarly to
the <strong>Tidy Messages</strong> table, it consists of one or more rows of information,
divided into multiple columns of data. As a standard macOS table, the
columns can be sorted, repositioned, and re-sized.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Severity</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The severity indicates the general type of condition that
<em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> encountered, and can be one of the following types.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Error</em> indicates a condition in the document that violates at least one
one aspect of the W3C specifications. Any quantity of <em>Errors</em> greater than
zero is an indication that your document has failed to validate.</li>
      <li><em>Error (Fatal)</em> also indicates an error, but additionally it was severe
enough that the validator was not able to continue parsing your document.</li>
      <li><em>Info</em> presents suggestions to improve the quality of your document. An
<em>Info</em> result does not indicate that the document failed to validate.</li>
      <li><em>Info (Warning)</em> Similar to <em>Info</em>, but a bit more stern.</li>
      <li><em>Non-Document Error</em> applies to issues that the validator is not equipped
to deal with due to an undocumented issue probably not related to your
document. You might consider reporting instances of this error to the
<a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues">issues list</a> for resolution.</li>
      <li><em>Non-Document Error (validator internal)</em> applies to issues that the 
validator is not equipped to deal with due to an undocumented issue 
probably not related to your document. You might consider reporting 
instances of this error to the <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues">issues list</a> for resolution.</li>
      <li><em>Non-Document Error (validator IO)</em> applies to issues that the validator 
is not equipped to deal with due to an undocumented issue probably not 
related to your document. You might consider reporting instances of this 
error to the <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues">issues list</a> for resolution.</li>
      <li><em>Non-Document Error (schema)</em> applies to issues that the validator is not 
equipped to deal with due to an undocumented issue probably not related to
your document. You might consider reporting instances of this error to the
<a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues">issues list</a> for resolution.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Location</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The location, if present, indicates the row and column position in the Source
HTML of the cause of the message. According to whether the table is
displaying results for <strong>Source HTML</strong> or <strong>Tidy HTML</strong>, selecting a row in
the table will move the code viewer to this location automatically, and 
highlight the location for you.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Message Description</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The description describes the condition that was found, which typically
instructs you how to resolve the issue.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="filtering-message-types">Filtering Message Types</h2>

<p>If you are working on documents with several errors and warnings, it may be
useful to concentrate on only certain message types at a time. You can display
the message type filter by choosing <strong>Filter Validator Messages</strong> in the Action
menu on the bottom, left hand side of the W3C Validator table.</p>

<p><figure>
  <img src="/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/whole/all-menu-context-validator.png" alt="validator messages action menu" class="menu_dropshadow" srcset="/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/whole/all-menu-context-validator.png 1x, /Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/whole/all-menu-context-validator@2x.png 2x" />
</figure></p>

<p>The filter controls will become visible at the bottom of the Tidy Messages
panel, as shown:</p>

<p><figure>

</figure></p>

<p>Use the standard macOS scope buttons to select only the messages types
that you would like to see.</p>

<p>The button titles indicate in parentheses the number of messages of that type,
if any.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-the-validator">Configuring the Validator</h2>

<p>By default, the <strong>W3C Validator</strong> is configured to work with the W3C Validor
online; if you prefer to work offline, are unable to get access through a proxy,
or wish to use the built-in validator, then additional configuration is needed.
Please consult the <a href="#/topic-prefs-prefs-validator" title="Validator">Validator Preferences</a> documentation.</p>
