<h1>Customize your Environment using Schemes</h1>

<p>You may already know that <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>’s <strong>Color Preferences</strong> panel can give
you control over the colors used in syntax highlighting and other editor
colors, but it also provides you the ability to save your favorite color
combinations into schemes that you can select and use easily. Perhaps you
prefer darker colors when working during the night, for example.</p>

<p>In addition <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> comes with several schemes already included.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-new-scheme">Create a new scheme</h2>

<p>Creating a new scheme is as simple as changing one of the color settings in
the <strong>Color Preferences</strong> panel. As soon as you do so, you will notice the the
name of the color scheme changes to “Custom Settings” and the <strong>Save Scheme</strong>
button is enabled.</p>

<p>Upon pressing the <strong>Save Scheme</strong> button, you will be asked for a name, which
will then be displayed replacing the “Custom Settings” name.</p>

<h2 id="delete-a-scheme">Delete a scheme</h2>

<p>If you selected a custom scheme, the <strong>Save Scheme</strong> button displays
<strong>Delete Scheme…</strong> instead. Pressing that button and then confirming the
dialog will delete your scheme.</p>

<p>Note, though, that you cannot delete the built-in schemes.</p>

<h2 id="scheme-location">scheme location</h2>

<p>In case you want to move your scheme files to another computer, or share them
with others, or for any reason you want to have access to your scheme outside
of <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>, you can find them in:</p>

<p><code>/Users/{your home folder}/Library/Containers/com.balthisar.Balthisar-Tidy.pro \
/Data/Library/Application Support/Balthisar Tidy for Work/Colour Schemes/</code></p>

<p>Please note the international English spelling of “Colour Schemes.”</p>

<p>This is the standard location for application data in sandboxed applications.</p>

<h2 id="identical-schemes">Identical schemes</h2>

<p><em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> doesn’t store the name of your theme in the user defaults system;
it stores all of the individual color information so that it can give you your
preferred environment in case the scheme file is deleted. When <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>
starts it then looks for a scheme that matches your color options and displays
its name.</p>

<p>One of the consequences of this is that if you have multiple schemes with the
same name then <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> will choose the first one according to your current
locale’s sorting settings (e.g., English locales will choose the first
matching theme alphabetically).</p>
