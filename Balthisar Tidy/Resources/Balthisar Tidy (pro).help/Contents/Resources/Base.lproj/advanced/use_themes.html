          <p>You may already know that <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>’s 
          <a title="Colors" href="../reference/prefs/prefs-colors.html">Color Preferences panel</a> can give you control over the colors
          used in syntax highlighting and other editor colors, but it also provides you
          the ability to save your favorite color combinations into themes that you can
          select and use easily. Perhaps you prefer darker colors when working during the
          night, for example.</p>
          
          <p>In addition <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> comes with several themes already included.</p>
          
          <h2 id="create-a-new-theme">Create a new theme</h2>
          
          <p>Creating a new theme is as simple as changing one of the color settings in the
          <a title="Colors" href="../reference/prefs/prefs-colors.html">Color Preferences panel</a>. As soon as you do so, you will notice
          the the name of the color scheme changes to “Custom Settings” and the
          <strong>Save Scheme</strong> button is enabled.</p>
          
          <p>Upon pressing the <strong>Save Scheme</strong> button, you will be asked for a name, which
          will then be displayed replacing the “Custom Settings” name.</p>
          
          <h2 id="delete-a-theme">Delete a theme</h2>
          
          <p>If you selected a custom theme, the <strong>Save Scheme</strong> button displays
          <strong>Delete Scheme…</strong> instead. Pressing that button and then confirming the
          dialog will delete your theme.</p>
          
          <p>Note, though, that you cannot delete the built-in themes.</p>
          
          <h2 id="theme-location">Theme location</h2>
          
          <p>In case you want to move your theme files to another computer, or share them
          with others, or for any reason you want to have access to your theme outside of
          <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>, you can find them in:</p>
          
          <p><code>/Users/{your home folder}/Library/Containers/com.balthisar.Balthisar-Tidy.pro/Data/Library/Application Support/Balthisar Tidy for Work/Colour Schemes/</code></p>
          
          <p>Please note the international English spelling of “Colour Schemes.”</p>
          
          <p>This is the standard location for application data in sandboxed applications.</p>
          
          <h2 id="identical-themes">Identical themes</h2>
          
          <p><em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> doesn’t store the name of your theme in the user defaults
          system; it stores all of the individual color information so that it can
          give you your preferred environment in case the theme file is deleted. When
          <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> starts it then looks for a theme that matches your color
          options and displays its name.</p>
          
          <p>One of the consequences of this is that if you have multiple themes with the
          same name then <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> will choose the first one
          according to your current locale’s sorting settings (e.g., English locales will
          choose the first matching theme alphabetically).</p>
