          <p class="note">The instructions and discussion on this page are intended for advanced users only. Some
          of the instructions require the use of the Mac OS X terminal and the <code>sudo</code> command.
          When <code>sudo</code> is abused or used improperly it has the potential affect your operating
          system.</p>
          
          <p><em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>, of course, uses TidyLib (<code>libtidy.dylib</code>) from the
          <a href="http://www.html-tidy.org/">HTML Tidy Project</a>, and it’s TidyLib that actually does the job of cleaning,
          repairing, and diagnosing your HTML.</p>
          
          <p>HTML Tidy (under new leadership by HTACG) is developing rapidly once again, and in
          many cases the Project will release new versions of Tidy faster than <strong>balthisar.com</strong>
          can keep up. The good news, though, is that if you’re an advanced user or not afraid to
          follow a couple of simple instructions, you can setup your computer so that
          <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> will use different (presumably newer) versions of <code>libtidy.dylib</code>
          installed by HTML Tidy.</p>
          
          <h2 id="how-to-use-a-different-tidylib">How to Use a Different TidyLib</h2>
          
          <div class="steps">
          
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Find a copy of <a href="http://www.html-tidy.org/">HTML Tidy</a> to install, and install it. This will ensure that
          TidyLib is installed in the correct location. And of course installing HTML Tidy
          nicely updates the Mac’s built-in, Apple-supplied version from 2006.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Create a symbolic link named <code>/usr/local/lib/libtidy-balthisar.dylib</code> that points to
          the library that you want to use.</p>
          
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>If you would like to use a specific version of <code>libtidy.dylib</code>, then use the
          following in Terminal.app, substituting the version number you want to use below:
          <code>sudo ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libtidy.5.1.9.dylib /usr/local/lib/libtidy-balthisar.dylib</code>
          You could repeat this every time you install a new version of HTML Tidy, or any time
          you would like to change the version of TidyLib that <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> uses.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>If you would simply like to use the most recently installed version (normally the newest
          version) use this in Terminal.app:
          <code>sudo ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libtidy.dylib /usr/local/lib/libtidy-balthisar.dylib</code>
          HTML Tidy installers always ensure that <code>libtidy.dylib</code> refers to the most recently
          installed version, so in this example any time you upgrade HTML Tidy,
          <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> effectively receives an instant upgrade, too.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To make <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> use its own, built-in version again, just remove the
          symlink in Terminal.app:
          <code>sudo rm /usr/local/lib/libtidy-balthisar.dylib</code></p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          
          </div>
          
          <h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
          
          <h2 id="how-does-this-work">How does this work?</h2>
          <p><em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> uses <code>libtidy-balthisar.dylib</code> within its application bundle.
          However Mac OS X’s dynamic loader will give preference to this dylib located in
          <code>/usr/local/lib/</code> (even when running in a sandbox).</p>
          
          <h2 id="why-not-make-a-preferences-option-instead">Why not make a Preferences option instead?</h2>
          <p>Because of application sandboxing (security) this is the only practical way to offer this
          feature to you. There’s nothing within the power of an application to select which
          library to link to, so it’s not possible to make this a Preferences option.</p>
          
          <h2 id="why-might-i-want-to-do-this">Why might I want to do this?</h2>
          <p>Sometimes HTML Tidy has bugs, and if the version of HTML Tidy that’s built into 
          <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> has bugs, then you can be sure that <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> has
          bugs, too.</p>
          
          <p>Because HTML Tidy’s development cycle is faster than <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>’s, this gives
          you the ability to upgrade <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> without waiting for an upgrade!</p>
          
          <h2 id="why-might-i-not-want-to-do-this">Why might I <em>not</em> want to do this?</h2>
          <p>Things might break. While HTML Tidy’s API is fairly stable, things can change. If a new
          Tidy Option is added, <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> probably won’t pick it up. If an option’s
          description changes, it won’t be reflected in <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>.</p>
          
          <p>If things <em>do</em> break, rest assured that you can restore <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> to its
          standard conditions by removing the symlink as described above.</p>
