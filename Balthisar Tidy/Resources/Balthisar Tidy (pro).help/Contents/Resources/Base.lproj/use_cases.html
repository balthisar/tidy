        <p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em> isn’t just an HTML pretty-printer; it promises to make sure
        your HTML is clean, error-free, and accessible. But it’s also much, much more.
        <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is an <em>HTML development tool</em>; it can be a <em>learning tool</em>;
        it’s a <em>diagnostic tool</em>; it’s a <em>batch processing tool</em>; it’s a graphical
        <em>feature discovery tool</em>. And, of course, it’s an HTML pretty-printer.</p>
        
        <p>How can you leverage <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> in each of these roles?</p>
        
        <h2 id="html-development-tool">HTML Development Tool</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re hand-crafting your HTML in <em>vim</em>, using a static site generator
        such as <em>middleman</em>, or using a commercial package such as <em>Dreamweaver</em>,
        <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> fits into your development chain prior to deployment. It will
        check compliance to standards, accessibility, and capture common errors. Tidy
        will normalize whitespace, sort attributes, ensure proper
        declarations, and detect logic errors.</p>
        
        <p>As a tool in your development chain, <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> is perfect for adding
        those finishing touches the ensure compliance to your standards prior to
        deploying your code.</p>
        
        <h2 id="learning-tool">Learning Tool</h2>
        <p>All developers know it: code quality is just as important as, if not more
        important than, the ability of the code to function. When learning to write XML
        or HTML, consider using <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> as a teaching aid. Its instant feedback
        will reinforce rules, style, and syntax that all good developers adhere to.</p>
        
        <h2 id="diagnostic-tool">Diagnostic Tool</h2>
        <p>“Tidy” doesn’t merely imply code formatting; it also means helping you eliminate
        bad stuff. Things like errors, logical inconsistencies, and deprecated language
        and syntax. <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> gives you a much needed sanity check before you
        ship.</p>
        
        <h2 id="feature-discovery-tool">Feature Discovery Tool</h2>
        <p>Tidy has a long history in the command line world. It also has dozens of option
        settings and inconsistent descriptions of what they do. Trial and error in the
        command line world can be a frustrating experience.</p>
        
        <p><em>Balthisar Tidy</em>, though, offers all of Tidy’s options in an efficient, easy-to-use
        GUI that provides instant Tidy-ing and instant feedback. If you don’t have the
        patience to read dry specifications, simply use <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> to discover the
        features that you want.</p>
        
        <h2 id="batch-processing-tool">Batch Processing Tool</h2>
        <p>Command line Tidy can be used in shell scripts, and using <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> as
        a feature discovery tool makes it easy to decide on the settings that you want
        to use with command line Tidy.</p>
        
        <p>If you’re lucky enough to have <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em>, then you also have the
        ability to generate a configuration file for command line Tidy directly from
        <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>!</p>
        
        <p>Finally as a <em>Balthisar Tidy for Work</em> user, you appreciate the better things in
        life and can skip shell scripts altogether. AppleScript support enables high-level
        scripting, automation, and interoperability with other Macintosh applications.
        With AppleScript you can batch process entire folder hierarchies, or even use
        Folder Actions to Tidy files automatically.</p>
        
        <h2 id="html-pretty-printer">HTML Pretty-Printer</h2>
        <p>And of course, <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> provides the same pretty-printing features that
        Tidy has been known for for years.</p>
