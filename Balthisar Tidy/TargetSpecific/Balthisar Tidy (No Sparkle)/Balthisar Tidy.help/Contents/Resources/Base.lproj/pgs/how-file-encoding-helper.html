<h1>Use the File Encoding Helper</h1>
<p>
	When <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> opens a document, it tries to use the Tidy option
	<kbd>input-encoding</kbd> in <a href="../reference/preferences.html">Preferences</a>.
	The typical modern practice is to use UTF-8 encoding for all files, however there
	are many legacy file encoding formats from different countries and different
	operating systems. <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> supports <em>every</em> encoding
	offered by Mac OS X.
</p>
<p>
	There is no tried and true way to determine the encoding format for most
	formats. For the most part, <em>Balthisar Tidy</em> will assume that you, the
	user, know what you are doing.
</p>
<p>
	In same cases, though, it’s obvious that the <kbd>input-encoding</kbd> is wrong.
	In these few cases, and when the <a href="prefs-miscellaneous.html">correct
	preference</a> is selected, Tidy will offer you the chance to change the
	encoding format, as shown below.
</p>

<p>
	Tidy’s criterion for success is whether opening the document yields any text at all.
	As shown in the warning, it’s still possible that the <kbd>input-encoding</kbd> is
	incorrect. You should examine the <a href="doc-source.html">Source HTML</a> (not the
	“Tidy’d HTML”!) to verify that the correct <kbd>input-encoding</kbd> is selected.
	If some non-Western characters still look incorrect, you can manually choose the
	correct <kbd>input-encoding</kbd> from the <a href="doc-tidy-options.html">Tidy
	Options</a> pane. If you use this <kbd>input-encoding</kbd>, you can also set it
	as the default in <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s
	<a href="prefs-default-tidy-options.html">Preferences</a>.
