# Exceptions (overrides) to Tidy pick list types.
#
# Because we want to use TidyLib as-is, there are some datatypes that Balthisar Tidy
# overrides to strings instead of using pick lists, because sometimes the pick lists
# don't make sense.

# Force `doctype` to string so that it won't use its picklist. The option `doctype-mode`
# should be used for picklist selection.
