/*
	TidyOption descriptions
 
	The following strings are intended to be used with JSDTidyOption's
	`localizedHumanReadableDescription` property instead of being used
	via NSLocalizedString (although NSLocalizedString will technically
	work).
 
	Using `localizedHumanReadableDescription` and prefixing an `*` to
	the strings will treat them as RTF strings enabling simple use
	of NSAttributedStrings.
 
	- Prefix * to strings to have them treated as RTF.
	
	- The RTF header is supplied automatically in JSDTidyOption.

	- \f0 is defined as Consolas font in JSDTidyOption.m.
	
	- \n newlines do not work if the string is RTF; instead use RTF's \\line
	
	NOTE: this flaggable mechanism exists because some localizations may not
	be able to use RTF.
 
	NOTE: items I've prefixed with --- have no special meaning; it's just
	a reminder to me that I'm not using them in Balthisar Tidy.
