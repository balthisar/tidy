Version 0.60 - Universal Binary
19-November-2007


CHANGES:
--------
* I've hidden the Batch Mode window, since I've not implemented it yet anyway.
* I've added a text to the Batch button in the preferences window to indicate
  that it doesn't really do anything yet.
* Upgrade the project file from "Project Builder" to "XCode 3.0." Yeah,
  Balthisar Tidy really *is* that old, and yeah, I really *have* neglected it
  for that much time.
* Compiled as a Universal Binary.


KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
* I've not tested this extensively, so for guaranteed quality, stick with
  the previous version 0.50. It's PPC only, but c'mon, it's small and runs
  at virtually native speeds being that it's a pure Cocoa application.
* For some reason, typing into a blank source box will crash Balthisar Tidy.
  You can still paste text into it, though. Honestly, because I've not gotten
  batch mode working or written a service for Balthisar Tidy, pasting in the
  old and copying the Tidy'd version is my personal preference. I'll consider
  fixing this as time permits, because it's nice being able to type a single
  word and having a full formed document appear!
* For some reason, Save As… for newly created documents (such as those pasted-
  in) doesn't seem to do anything. If you open a document into Tidy, though,
  it will Save As… okay.
* For some reason, Balthisar Tidy doesn't respect UTF-8 and maybe other text
  encodings when opening a file. It does swell when you paste into the Tidy
  source box, though. Honestly I don't know if this is new bad behavior or
  if it's like this in version 0.50. I've learned a lot about file encodings
  since then, so I'll get around to fixing it. In any case, if you use numeric
  entities for all but the 7-bit ASCII set, you won't be affected. Personally,
  I like UTF-8's ability to use my native Mac character set, and be assured that
  the characters work on all platforms' browsers.
