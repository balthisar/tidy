/**
 *  MGSUserDefaultsController and its related class are alternatives to
 *  NSUserDefaults and NSUserDefaultsController, which support being able to
 *  manage multiple sets of the same defaults keys for multiple instances of an
 *  object. This can be particularly useful when binding to user-interface
 *  controls.
 *
 *  In order to support shared defaults, i.e., a default that serves as a master
 *  for multiple instances, there's also a global default. For example if you
 *  wish to ensure that multiple text views' `backgroundColor` is shared, you
 *  can specify that that `backgroundColor` is a global property.
 *
 *  Where persistent defaults are stored is implementation-dependent. This
 *  implementation uses NSUserDefaults as its backend, but you shouldn't use
 *  NSUserDefaults to access them.
