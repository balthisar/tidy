<% if target_name?(:app) %>

The former _Balthisar Tidy_ is now called _Balthisar Tidy Classic_, because it’s
going to age without any future updates. It is no more, and has ceased to be.
It’s expired and ignored by its maker. Its system processes are now history.
This is an ex-application.
{: .note .callout}

Instead, you should use the **new** [Balthisar Tidy][1]
(fomerly _Balthisar Tidy for Work_). Just like _Balthisar Tidy Classic_,
_Balthisar Tidy_ is free, and offers all of the same features you’ve used for
years.

When you’re ready to switch, the following _optional_, in-app purchase becomes
available to you.

This is an advertisement. It’s fairly unobtrusive and hidden in a help file,
and so we at **balthisar.com** don’t feel too guilty for plugging a paid
upgrade: _Balthisar Tidy Pro_.
<% if target_name?(:pro) %>
And because you’re already using _Balthisar Tidy_, it’s a simple, in-app
purchase.
<% end %>
<% if target_name?(:web) %>
It’s only available as an optional in-app purchase in the [App Store version][1]
of _Balthisar Tidy_ (you are using the web-distributed version). Read on, and
when you’re ready to switch, it will be easy.

Here’s The Intellectual Incentive
---------------------------------
_Balthisar Tidy Pro_ gives you all of the great features of _Balthisar Tidy_
with a few extra goodies to make the upgrade worth it:

**Customize the Syntax Highlighting and Use Themes**
 : _Balthisar Tidy Pro_ gives you full control over the editor colors and
    the colors used to syntax highlight your code. Even better you can assign
    these color combinations to custom themes and change them at will. Several
    attractive themes are already included in _Balthisar Tidy Pro_.

**Side-by-Side Browser Preview with Optional Scroll Locking**
 : With _Balthisar Tidy Pro_ you can observe the Browser Preview for both
   the **Source HTML** and **Tidy HTML** side-by-side at the same time to ensure
   that the work Tidy performed did not change how your document renders.

**AppleScript Support**
 : Leverage the automation that AppleScript enables and introduce _Balthisar
   Tidy Pro_ into your complex projects.

**Export Tidy’d Output as Rich Text**
 : If you’re working in an environment with code reviews or management reports
   you might want to have a syntax colored version of your HTML available for
   use. _Balthisar Tidy Pro_ can output its Tidy’d text into an RTF file.

**Export and Import Command Line Configuration Files**
 : _Balthisar Tidy_ has a great UI, but sometimes you need to use command line
   Tidy as part of your workflow. Why not let _Balthisar Tidy Pro_ help you
   by using its superb GUI to develop your settings, and exporting them into a
   ready-to-use configuration for command line Tidy?

   And if you already have configuration files for command line Tidy, _Balthisar
   Tidy Pro_ can import and use them, too.

**Top Secret, In-Development Features**
 : We’ve got a lot more planned for _Balthisar Tidy Pro_. Upgrade your copy of
   <%= pne %> now before the price goes up!


And Here’s the Emotional Appeal
-------------------------------
_Balthisar Tidy_ is a fun product to work on, and fun and pride in craftsmanship
is really our chief motivation at **balthisar.com**.

**Our primary motivation to charge for _Balthisar Tidy For Pro_ is to
pay for language localization.**

_Balthisar Tidy_ is free and always will be (in fact, it’s free and open
source). Sure, some of the development tools cost money and distribution in the
App Store requires a yearly, paid membership, but these are relatively low costs
that contribute to our enjoyment. But language localization is expensive, much
too expensive to eat out of pocket.

So, here’s the deal: 100% of the net proceeds from _Balthisar Tidy Pro_
will be used to pay for language localizations, prioritized by the number of
sales in each language region.

And, hey, if you already speak English and don’t care about the Latvians, then
consider upgrading to _Balthisar Tidy Pro_ on its merits alone.
