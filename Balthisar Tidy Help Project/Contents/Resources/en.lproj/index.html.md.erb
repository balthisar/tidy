Use <%= pne %> to sweep away your poor HTML clutter. It’s an HTML development
tool, learning aid, diagnostic appliance, feature discovery tool, batch
processing machine, and HTML pretty printer that _also_ provides document
validation.

<% if target_name?(:app) %>

The former _Balthisar Tidy_ is now called _Balthisar Tidy Classic_, because it’s
going to age without any future updates. It is no more, and has ceased to be.
It’s expired and ignored by its maker. Its system processes are now history.
This is an ex-application. Instead, you should use the **new**
[Balthisar Tidy][3].
