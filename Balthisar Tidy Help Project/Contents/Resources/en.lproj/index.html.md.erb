Use <%= pne %> to sweep away your poor HTML clutter. It’s an HTML development
tool, learning aid, diagnostic appliance, feature discovery tool, batch
processing machine, and HTML pretty printer that _also_ provides document
validation.

Please upgrade to the new [_Balthisar Tidy_][3] version 5.0 as soon as it
becomes available (it will be free of charge). This version is now called
_Balthisar Tidy Classic_, because like a fine wine, it’s going to age without
any further input (or updates). It is no more, and has ceased to be. It’s
expired and ignored by its maker. Its system processes are now history. This is
an ex-application.
