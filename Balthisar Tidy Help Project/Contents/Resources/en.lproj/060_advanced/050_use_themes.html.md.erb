You may already know that <%= pne %>’s **Color Preferences** panel can give
you control over the colors used in syntax highlighting and other editor
colors, but it also provides you the ability to save your favorite color
combinations into schemes that you can select and use easily. Perhaps you
prefer darker colors when working during the night, for example.

In addition <%= pne %> comes with several schemes already included.

Create a new scheme
-------------------

Creating a new scheme is as simple as changing one of the color settings in
the **Color Preferences** panel. As soon as you do so, you will notice the the
name of the color scheme changes to “Custom Settings” and the **Save Scheme**
button is enabled.

Upon pressing the **Save Scheme** button, you will be asked for a name, which
will then be displayed replacing the “Custom Settings” name.


Delete a scheme
---------------

If you selected a custom scheme, the **Save Scheme** button displays
**Delete Scheme…** instead. Pressing that button and then confirming the
dialog will delete your scheme.

Note, though, that you cannot delete the built-in schemes.


Dark Mode
---------
Starting with macOS 10.14, a new “dark mode” is available. <%= pne %> offers
full support for dark mode by preserving scheme settings per mode. For example,
you might prefer a white background when in light mode and a black background
when in dark mode.

Color settings that you apply in each appearance mode will be applied each time
you change macOS appearance modes. 


Scheme location
---------------

In case you want to move your scheme files to another computer, or share them
with others, or for any reason you want to have access to your scheme outside
of <%= pne %>, you can find them in:

~~~
/Users/{your home folder}/Library/Containers/com.balthisar.Balthisar-Tidy.pro \
   /Data/Library/Application Support/Balthisar Tidy for Work/Colour Schemes/
~~~

Please note the international English spelling of “Colour Schemes.”

This is the standard location for application data in sandboxed applications.


Identical schemes
-----------------

<%= pne %> doesn’t store the name of your theme in the user defaults system;
it stores all of the individual color information so that it can give you your
preferred environment in case the scheme file is deleted. When <%= pne %>
starts it then looks for a scheme that matches your color options and displays
its name.

One of the consequences of this is that if you have multiple schemes with the
same name then <%= pne %> will choose the first one according to your current
locale’s sorting settings (e.g., English locales will choose the first
matching theme alphabetically).
