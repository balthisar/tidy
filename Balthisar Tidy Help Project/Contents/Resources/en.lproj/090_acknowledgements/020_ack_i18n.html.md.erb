Help Us Help You!
-----------------

<%= pne %> is used around the world, so why not help us make it available in
_your_ native language?

Those of us at **balthisar.com** speak a couple of languages in addition to
English, but the quality isnâ€™t nearly enough for our high standards for quality
software.

### Help out!

The source code to <%= pne %> is on
[github](https://github.com/balthisar/tidy). Have a look at the repository,
choose a language, and help make <%= pne %> yours.

### Sponsor a language personally or commercially

If you or a company that you have a relationship with would like to sponsor one
or more translations of <%= pne %>, please get in contact with us. Aside from
doing a good deed, you and/or your organization will have prominent placement on
this page for all posterity.
