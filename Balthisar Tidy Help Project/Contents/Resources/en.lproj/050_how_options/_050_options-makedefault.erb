You can use <%= pne %>’s **Tidy Options** panel to work with a document until
you are satisfied that Tidy produces the results that you want. It’s very easy
to apply a document’s settings to [Preferences][prefs-tidyoptions] automatically
so that they will be the default settings for the next document that you open.

1. Access the menu at the bottom of the **Tidy Options** panel in the document
   that you want to use as the source for the new default settings.
   ![options context menu](all-menu-context-options){: .menu_dropshadow}

2. Select **Save these option settings to Preferences**.

3. If you open a document or create a new document, you will see that the new
   defaults are now active.

4. When you open [Preferences][prefs-tidyoptions] you will see that the new
   defaults are now active.
