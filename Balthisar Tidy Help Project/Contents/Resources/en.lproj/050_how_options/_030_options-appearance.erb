<%= pne %> lets you choose several options to help you balance its
beautiful appearance with your productivity. Follow this series of steps to
discover some ways you can change the appearance of the **Tidy Options** panel.

1. You can choose **Show friendly option names** and choose **Show options in
   groups** using the menu at the bottom of the **Tidy Options** panel.
   ![menu](all-menu-context-options){: .menu_dropshadow}
   Choosing these options affects only the current window.

2. You can choose default behaviour for new windows in [Preferences][prefs-tidyappearance].
   In addition to the options above, Preferences gives you control over the
   hover effect used in the **Tidy Options** list, the row appearance, and more.
   ![prefs](all-tidy-prefs-Options){: .dropshadow}
