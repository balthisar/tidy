Delete User Defaults
--------------------

You can delete all of <%= pne %>’s user defaults quite easily by quitting
<%= pne %> and then launching it again while holding down the 
**Command** key.

Alternatively, simply issue this command in **Terminal**:

<% if target_name?(:web) %>
`defaults delete com.balthisar.web.free.balthisar-tidy`
<% elsif target_name?(:app) %>
`defaults delete com.balthisar.Balthisar-Tidy`
<% else %>
`defaults delete com.balthisar.Balthisar-Tidy.pro`
<% end %>


<% if target_feature?(:feature_supports_themes) %>
Delete Color Schemes
--------------------

If you use the **Colors Preferences** to save schemes, then <%= pne %> stores
data in your home folder:

~~~
${home}/Library/Containers/com.balthisar.Balthisar-Tidy.pro/ \
   Data/Library/Application Support/Balthisar Tidy for Work/ \
   Colour Schemes/
~~~

You can delete these scheme files manually in **Finder**, or use the `rm`
command in **Terminal**:

~~~
rm ~/Library/Containers/com.balthisar.Balthisar-Tidy.pro/ \
   Data/Library/Application Support/Balthisar Tidy for Work/ \
   Colour Schemes/*.plist
~~~


<% end %>
