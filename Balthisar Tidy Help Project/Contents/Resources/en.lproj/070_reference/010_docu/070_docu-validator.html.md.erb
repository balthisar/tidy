title: The W3C Validator Table
blurb: The Tidy Messages table is the primary means of communicating to you the
       changes that Balthisar Tidy wants to make to your document.

The **W3C Validator** table indicates the validation status of either your
original source document or the Tidyâ€™d version of the document. Similarly to
the **Tidy Messages** table, it consists of one or more rows of information,
divided into multiple columns of data. As a standard <%= mac_os %> table, the
columns can be sorted, repositioned, and re-sized.

**Severity**

 : The severity indicates the general type of condition that
   <%= pne %> encountered, and can be one of the following types.

   - _Error_ indicates a condition in the document that violates at least one
     one aspect of the W3C specifications. Any quantity of _Errors_ greater than
     zero is an indication that your document has failed to validate. 
   - _Error (Fatal)_ also indicates an error, but additionally it was severe
     enough that the validator was not able to continue parsing your document.
   - _Info_ presents suggestions to improve the quality of your document. An
     _Info_ result does not indicate that the document failed to validate.
   - _Info (Warning)_ Similar to _Info_, but a bit more stern.
   - _Non-Document Error_ applies to issues that the validator is not equipped
     to deal with due to an undocumented issue probably not related to your
     document. You might consider reporting instances of this error to the
     [issues list][1] for resolution.
   - _Non-Document Error (validator internal)_ applies to issues that the 
     validator is not equipped to deal with due to an undocumented issue 
     probably not related to your document. You might consider reporting 
     instances of this error to the [issues list][1] for resolution.
   - _Non-Document Error (validator IO)_ applies to issues that the validator 
     is not equipped to deal with due to an undocumented issue probably not 
     related to your document. You might consider reporting instances of this 
     error to the [issues list][1] for resolution.
   - _Non-Document Error (schema)_ applies to issues that the validator is not 
     equipped to deal with due to an undocumented issue probably not related to
     your document. You might consider reporting instances of this error to the
     [issues list][1] for resolution.
 
**Location**

 : The location, if present, indicates the row and column position in the Source
   HTML of the cause of the message. According to whether the table is
   displaying results for **Source HTML** or **Tidy HTML**, selecting a row in
   the table will move the code viewer to this location automatically, and 
   highlight the location for you.

**Message Description**

 : The description describes the condition that was found, which typically
   instructs you how to resolve the issue.
 

Filtering Message Types
-----------------------

If you are working on documents with several errors and warnings, it may be
useful to concentrate on only certain message types at a time. You can display
the message type filter by choosing **Filter Validator Messages** in the Action
menu on the bottom, left hand side of the W3C Validator table.

![validator messages action menu](all-menu-context-validator){: .menu_dropshadow}

The filter controls will become visible at the bottom of the Tidy Messages
panel, as shown:

![validator message type filter](all-docpart-validator-filter)

Use the standard <%= mac_os %> scope buttons to select only the messages types
that you would like to see.

The button titles indicate in parentheses the number of messages of that type,
if any.


Configuring the Validator
-------------------------

By default, the **W3C Validator** is configured to work with the W3C Validator
online; if you prefer to work offline, are unable to get access through a proxy,
or wish to use the built-in validator, then additional configuration is needed.
Please consult the [Validator Preferences][prefs-validator] documentation.
