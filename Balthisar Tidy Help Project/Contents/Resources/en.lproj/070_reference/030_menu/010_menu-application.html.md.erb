<% current_page.data.title = product_name %>

<%= pne %> uses standard <%= mac_os %> menus that an experienced or novice user
should find self-explanatory. The menu items’ descriptions below are limited to
the features unique to <%= pne %>.

![application menu](all-menu-application){: .menu_dropshadow}

The application menu is a completely standard Macintosh application menu.

<% if target_feature?(:feature_sparkle) %>
Because you’re using a version of <%= pne %> from the **balthisar.com** website,
you get one extra feature: **Check for updates…** will perform an automatic
check for a new version of <%= pne %>, and if you want to, <%= pne %> will even
update itself.
<% end %>


Services Submenu
----------------
<%= pne %> also offers one or more [System Services][service] that can be
accessed via the **Services** submenu, as shown here.

![Services Menu](all-menu-services){: .menu_dropshadow}

This menu with <%= pne %>’s Services is available in *other* applications for
use there. This lets you do things such as Tidy text using <%= pne %> within,
e.g., **BBEdit** without leaving BBEdit.
