<%= md_links %>

<%= pne %> uses standard <%= mac_os %> menus that an experienced
or novice user should find self-explanatory. The menu items’ descriptions
below are limited to the features unique to <%= pne %>.

![edit menu](all-menu-edit){: .menu_dropshadow}

The **Edit** menu has many commands that are standard in <%= mac_os %>, but
offers several more options that are useful for a text editor such as
<%= pne %>.

**Shift Left** and **Shift Right**

 : These command perform block indentation of selected text in the 
   **Source HTML** pane, using the indentation character and type as specified
   in the [Editor Preferences][prefs-editor].
   
**Trim Whitespace**

 : This command removes unnecessary whitespace from the source document, such as
   extra spaces at the ends of lines, and empty lines at the end of the 
   document.

**Remove Line Endings**

 : Using this command removes all line breaks from the source document.

**Entab…** and **Detab…**

 : These two commands will convert the source document indentation whitespace
   from spaces to tabs, or from tabs to spaces, respectively.
 
**Transpose Tidy to Source**

 : Using this command will copy the current contents of the **Tidy HTML** panel
   into the **Source HTML** panel. <%= pne %> will try its best to preserve your
   insertion point location, but this is not always successful.
 
**Substitutions**

 : Although this is a standard <%= mac_os %> menu item, it bears pointing out
   because the settings here can affect the editing of your source code. For
   example HTML attribute values must not be surrounded by Smart Quotes.
