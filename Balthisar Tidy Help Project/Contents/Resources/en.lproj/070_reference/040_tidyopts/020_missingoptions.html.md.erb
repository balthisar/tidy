If you’re a long time command line Tidy user, you may find that some option
that you’re accustomed to using seems to be missing from <%= pne %>. This
section will explain why they appear to be missing, workarounds, and
explanations.

<%= pne %> isn’t a rewrite of Tidy; it uses the same code as traditional
command line Tidy, and supports _all_ of Tidy’s options, in some cases
replacing them with <%= mac_os %>’s superior implementation.

This summary should provide an explanation for the differences between Tidy’s
options and <%= pne %>’s options.

`char-encoding`
: <%= pne %> hides this option in favor of handling `input-encoding` and
  `output-encoding` separately. The main motivation for this is to take
  advantage of <%= mac_os %>’s vast array of file encoding options compared to
  the limited options offered by Tidy proper.

`markup`
: This option is used with command line Tidy to hide or show the Tidy’d
  document on the command line. Because <%= pne %> always shows the Tidy’d
  document, this option isn’t available.

`doctype-mode`
: Although sometimes command line Tidy will accept setting this option, it’s
  officially defined as “read-only” by Tidy’s application programming interface.
  <%= pne %> supports `doctype` as it should.

`drop-font-tags`
: Deprecated

`hide-endtags`
: Deprecated

`language`
: Deprecated

`slide-style`
: Deprecated

`split`
: These options have been deprecated by Tidy, and have been removed entirely
  in recent versions of Tidy, and so there's no reason to support them.

`error-file`
: Not applicable

`gnu-emacs`
: Not applicable

`gnu-emacs-file`
: Not applicable

`keep-time`
: Not applicable

`output-bom`

`output-file`

`quiet`
: Not applicable

`show-error`
: Not applicable

`show-filename`
: Not applicable

`show-info`
: Not applicable

`show-warnings`
: Not applicable

`write-back`
: These are all options that apply to command line Tidy only, and/or are handled
  directly by <%= pne %>.
