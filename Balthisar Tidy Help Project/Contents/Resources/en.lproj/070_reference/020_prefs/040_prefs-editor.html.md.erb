The Editor Preferences Panel exposes all of <%= pne %>’s advanced
text editor features.

Dark Mode
---------
Versions of macOS 10.14 and newer offer a “dark mode” in addition to the
traditional “light mode.” Of course, <%= pne %> is fully compatible with this 
macOS feature, and extends that compatibility by retaining separate Editor
Preferences for each view mode. For example, you may want to **Highlight the
current line** in light mode, but find this too distracting in dark mode.

Simply set the Editor Preferences you like in each mode, and they will be
faithfully preserved each time you change modes in the future.
