The **Updates** Preferences panel helps you control if and when automatic
software update checks are performed, as well as allows you to control what sort
of statistical information that <%= pne %> sends when it performs a
check for updates.

![tidy prefs panel](all-tidy-prefs-Updates){: .dropshadow}

<%= pne %> is able to update itself to new versions directly from
**balthisar.com**, if you allow it.

Additionally <%= pne %> requests your permission to collect anonymous
system information during update checks. This information is used to help
balthisar.com target its development resources. The information is truly
anonymous and you can read about what is collected
[here](http://sparkle-project.org/documentation/system-profiling).


Preferences Descriptions
------------------------

| **Automatically check for updates**             | If selected, <%= pne %> will check for newer versions of itself at the interval that you select. Additionally you can choose to automatically download and install available updates.
| **Send anonymous system profile during checks** | If selected, <%= pne %> will send basic information about your computer to balthisar.com (and no one else) during software update checks. This information is used only to help us improve <%= pne %>.

Despite what you allow for anonymous system profile during checks, as of this
current version of <%= pne %>, no data is being collected. Our website is a
static website with no ability to collect data. This might change in the future,
though, so please do keep track of this setting if you wish to guard this aspect
of your privacy.
