Dark Mode
---------
Versions of macOS 10.14 and newer offer a “dark mode” in addition to the
traditional “light mode.” Of course, <%= pne %> is fully compatible with this 
macOS feature, and extends that compatibility by retaining separate Colors
Preferences for each view mode.

Simply set the Colors Preferences you like in each mode, and they will be
faithfully preserved each time you change modes in the future.


Preferences Descriptions
------------------------

### Color Scheme

| **Color Scheme** | Allows you to manage settings a scheme, as described in the [color schemes][use_themes] documentation.


### Editor Colors

| **Text**                   | The text font color.
| **Background**             | The source panels’ background color.
| **Error Highlighting**     | The color to use to highlight errors in the text.
| **Current Line Highlight** | The color to use to highlight the current line, i.e., the line with the cursor.
| **Insertion Point**        | Specify the color to use for the insertion point.
| **Invisible Characters**   | Indicates the color used to show invisible characters.


### Syntax Highlighting Colors

Specify the color and basic formatting (bold, italic, and/or underline) for
syntax highlighting.

Not all of these apply to every HTML document. Because the source panels are
capable of working with multiple, other languages, some items such as 
“attribute” don’t necessarily exist in HTML documents.

| **Attribute**     | The color and format to use for attributes.
| **Auto-complete** | When enabled, all words in the document that are also in the auto complete dictionary will be colored the specified color.
| **HTML/XML Tag**  | The color and format  to use for tags.
| **Comment**       | The color and format  to use for comments.
| **Number**        | The color and format  to use for numbers.
| **String**        | The color and format  to use for strings.
| **Variable**      | The color and format  to use for variables.

### Uncategorized

| **Color multi-line strings**                                                | If enabled, the source editor will attempt to color strings that bridge multiple lines.
| **Only color until the end of the line if the closing tag cannot be found** | If enabled, syntax coloring will only color to the end of the starting line if the closing tag cannot be found. For poorly written documents, this may improve the display.
