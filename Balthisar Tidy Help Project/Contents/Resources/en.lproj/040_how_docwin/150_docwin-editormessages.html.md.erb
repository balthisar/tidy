<%= md_links %>

You can work much closer to <%= pne %>â€™s messages by displaying
them in the line number gutter and having their locations marked directly in
your source document. By configuring <%= pne %> in this way, respective messages
will be available in the gutter(s) when the Feedback panel is open, and
**Tidy Messages** or the **W3C Validator** is active.

1. First make sure that the gutter is visible by using the **Gutter** menu
   item of the **Source Code** submenu of the **View** menu.
   ![source code submenu](all-menu-view-sourcecode){: .menu_dropshadow}
   
2. Also make sure that **Show Errors** is enabled in the **Editor** pane of
   **Preferences**.
   ![editor pane](all-tidy-prefs-Editing){: .dropshadow}.

3. Ensure that the Feedback panel is not hidden, and select either the
   **Tidy Messages** tab or the **W3C Validator** tab to see respective
   messages.

4. If your document contains errors or generates messages, you will see
   an icon representing the error level of the most severe error on that line
   in the line number gutter. This image shows a sample from **Tidy Messages**.
   ![source editor](all-docpart-source)
   
   If **W3C Validator** is active, then validation messages may be present in
   both the **Source HTML** and **Tidy HTML** panels.

5. Clicking on a message icon will reveal a popup list of Tidy messages with a
   corresponding icon indicating the error level for each message. This image
   shows a sample from **Tidy Messages**.

Remember, when the Feedback panel is hidden, these messages are hidden as well.
