In addition to the ability to [toggle the Tidy Options][docwin-hidetidyoptions]
and [toggle the Feedback Panel][docwin-hidefeedbackarea] panels, you can change
the relative size of every document panel by using the splitters.

1. The splitters are impossible to see, but your mouse cursor will change shape
   when it passes over one of the splitters.
   ![left-right cursor][all-cursor-splitter-leftright]
   ![up-down cursor][all-cursor-splitter-updown]

2. At this point you can press and drag with the mouse to resize the adjacent
   areas.
