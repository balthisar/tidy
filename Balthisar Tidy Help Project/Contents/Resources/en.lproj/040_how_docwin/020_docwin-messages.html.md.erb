The **Tidy Messages** table is a critical tool that you will use and should
understand. It is what tells you what changes Tidy has made to your source
document, and it communicates errors to you that it was unable to fix.

Follow these steps to become acquainted with the **Tidy Messages** table.

1. Ensure that the tab **Tidy Messages** is selected in the panel at the bottom
   of the document window.

2. Observe the messages table, which consists of one or more rows of information
   indicating data about your document.
   ![messages](all-docpart-messages)

3. Each row will contain a **Severity**, a **Location**, and a **Message
   Description**, as [described in the reference][docu-messages].

4. Clicking on a row that contains a location will move the **Source HTML** view
   to that location, as this example shows:
   ![source html](all-docpart-source)
   
5. If you are only interested in certain types of messages, you can enable a
   [message type filter][docu-messages] in the Action menu at the bottom of the
   **Tidy Messages** panel.
