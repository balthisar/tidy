One of the benefits of having <%= pne %> is its added ability to help you work
more efficiently with command line Tidy.

Command line Tidy (on all platforms) can use a configuration file to affect how
it generates output. Now that you’ve done the hard work of discovering your
perfect settings using <%= pne %>, you can export a configuration file for use
with command line Tidy. Follow the steps below to learn how, and consider
reading the discussion that follows.

1. From either the **Tidy** panel in **Preferences** or from any open
   document, select the menu at the bottom of the **Tidy Options** list and
   find the **Export a Unix config file with these options…** menu choice.
   ![context menu](all-menu-context-options){: .menu_dropshadow}

2. <%= pne %> will present a standard file saving dialog. Although a
   suggested name is given, command line Tidy doesn’t care about filenames or
   extensions.

3. To use the options file with command line Tidy, invoke command line Tidy
   like this: \\
   `tidy -config configfile.cfg dirtyfile.html`


Discussion
----------

<%= pne %> does not supply a version of command line Tidy, but it is installed
by default on <%= mac_os %> computers and easily available for Linux and Unix
distributions, and an installer is available for Windows.

<%= pne %> uses a cutting-edge version of Tidy. It’s more advanced than the
version that comes pre-installed on <%= mac_os %>. This generally means that
command line Tidy will fail to handle conditions that <%= pne %> handles
correctly, such as simple HTML5. On <%= mac_os %>, <%= pne %>’s support for
automation technologies (such as AppleScript) can permit you to use the latest
Tidy technology without sacrificing your automated workflow. Alternatively it is
suggested that you install a [new version](http://www.html-tidy.org) of command
line Tidy.
{: .note }

If your HTML and XML files use legacy character encodings, e.g., if they are not
UTF8, please double-check the configuration file that <%= pne %> exports in
order to ensure that it includes the correct legacy Tidy `input-encoding` and
`output-encoding` values for your files. <%= pne %> supports _every_ 
<%= mac_os %> character encoding, whereas command line Tidy _does not_.
