Although you’re always welcome to email us at [balthisar@balthisar.com][1] or

following options?

- Ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version of _<%= product_name %>_.
  <% if target_feature?(:feature_sparkle) %>
  Use **Check for Updates…** in the **Balthisar Tidy** main menu. You may also
  consider enabling automatic update checking in **Preferences**.
  <% else %>
  Check the **App Store** to ensure that there are no pending updates awaiting
  your approval. The **App Store** can be setup to download all updates
  automatically.
  <% end %>

- Check _<%= product_name %>_’s [FAQs][3].

- Have a look at _<%= product_name %>_’s [support page][4], which always has
  up-to-date support information.
