==============================

If you’re a long time command line Tidy user, you may find that some option that
you’re accustomed to using seems to be missing from <%= pne %>. This
section will explain why they appear to be missing, workarounds, and
explanations.

<%= pne %> isn’t a rewrite of Tidy; it uses the same code as
traditional command line Tidy, and supports _all_ of Tidy’s options, in some
cases replacing them with <%= mac_os %>’s superior implementation.

This summary should provide an explanation for the differences between Tidy’s
options and <%= pne %>’s options.

`char-encoding`
 : <%= pne %> hides this option in favor of handling `input-encoding` and
  `output-encoding` separately. The main motivation for this is to take advantage
  of <%= mac_os %>’s vast array of file encoding options compared to the limited options
  offered by Tidy proper.

`markup`
 : This option is used with command line Tidy to hide or show the Tidy’d
   document on the command line. Because <%= pne %> always shows the Tidy’d
   document, this option isn’t available.

`doctype-mode`
 : Although sometimes command line Tidy will accept setting this option, it’s
   officially defined as “read-only” by Tidy’s application programming interface.
   <%= pne %> supports `doctype` as it should.

`drop-font-tags`
`hide-endtags`
`language`
`slide-style`
`split`
 : These options have been deprecated by Tidy, and have been removed entirely
   in recent versions of Tidy, and so there's no reason to support them.

`error-file`
`gnu-emacs`
`gnu-emacs-file`
`keep-time`
`output-bom`
`output-file`
`quiet`
`show-error`
`show-info`
`show-warnings`
`write-back`
 : These are all options that apply to command line Tidy only, and/or are handled
   directly by <%= pne %>.
