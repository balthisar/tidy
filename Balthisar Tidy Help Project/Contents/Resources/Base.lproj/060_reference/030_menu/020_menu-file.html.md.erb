<%= current_page.data.title %>
==============================

<%= pne %> uses standard <%= mac_os %> menus that an experienced or novice user
should find self-explanatory. The menu items’ descriptions below are limited to
the features unique to <%= pne %>.

<div class="image_article" markdown="1">
<div markdown="span">
    ![file menu](all-menu-file)
</div>

<% if target_feature?(:feature_exports_rtf) %>
The **File** menu is a completely standard Macintosh File menu, with the added
item [Export as RTF…][use_exportrtf].
<% else %>
The **File** menu is a completely standard Macintosh File menu.
<% end %>

</div>

<div class="image_article" markdown="1">
<div markdown="span">
    ![file menu](all-menu-file-alternate)
</div>

Note that as is common in many <%= mac_os %> applications, <%= pne %> offers an
alternate form of the **File** menu that is displayed when the `Option` key (⌥)
is pressed.

Of special note is the **Save Source HTML As…** option, which provides you the
opportunity to save the contents of the **Source HTML** panel in the event that
you do not wish to accept the Tidy’d version as present in the **Tidy HTML**
panel.
