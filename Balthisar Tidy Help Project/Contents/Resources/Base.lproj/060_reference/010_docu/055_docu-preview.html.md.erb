<%= current_page.data.title %>
==============================

The **Browser Preview** panel is where you can review how <%= pne %>’s changes
affect how your source code is rendered. You can see how the browser renders
your Source HTML or the Tidy HTML, giving you a good opportunity to compare
them.

<% if target_feature?(:feature_supports_SxS_preview) %>
And because you were generous enough to purchase <%= pne %>, you can even view
the Source HTML and Tidy HTML rendered side by side, optionally enable
synchronized scrolling, and see instantly what differences (if any) there are.
<% end %>

Present on the bottom of the **Browser Preview** panel are an action menu as
well as a label indicating which HTML source code is currently displayed. Use
the Action menu to do any of the following:

![action menu](all-menu-context-preview)

**Set base URL for external assets…**

 : Most web pages load external assets such as cascading style sheets or images,
   and these are often loaded with a relative URL path. If your document counts
   on relative paths to external assets, you can use this menu command to choose
   the base URL for such assets.

**Clear base URL for external assets**

 : Use this menu command if you no longer wish to load external assets from the
   directory you’ve chosen.

**Show Source HTML**

 : This menu command will show the text in the **Source HTML** panel in the
   **Browser Preview**. This can be useful if you suspect that Tidy is changing
   how your page is rendering.

**Show Tidy HTML**

 : By default <%= pne %> displays the result of the **Tidy HTML**
   panel in the **Browser Preview**. If you have changed to another view, then
   this menu command will return to the default.

<% if target_feature?(:feature_supports_SxS_preview) %>

**Compare Side by Side**

 : This command changes the **Browser Preview** to a split view mode, and 
   displays the untidy **Source HTML** on the left and the tidy’d **Tidy HTML**
   on the right. In this mode you can optionally enable **Lock Scrolling**.

**Compare Over and Under**

 : This command changes the **Browser Preview** to a split view mode, and 
   displays the untidy **Source HTML** on the top and the tidy’d **Tidy HTML**
   on the bottom. In this mode you can optionally enable **Lock Scrolling**.

**Lock Scrolling**

 : Use this command to turn on the **Lock Scrolling** option when you are
   viewing any of the split view **Compare** modes. This option synchronize both
   of the views so that they scroll together. This can be useful to ensure that
   characteristics such as spacing haven’t been changed by Tidy’ing.

<% end %>

<% if target_feature?(:feature_supports_SxS_preview) %>

## Compare Side by Side and Compare Over and Under

These two view modes (exclusive to <%= pne %>) make it dead simple to
compare the original document and the Tidy’d document, as rendered. Ideally
both versions will be identical, and this view mode gives you that assurance.

This image shows a complete document window with the “Compare Side by Side”
preview mode:

Note that in these split view modes the individual Browser Preview panes are
separated by a [resizable splitter][docu-splitters].

## Browser Preview Throttle

The Browser Preview is very, very fast, and it will keep up with your typing in
the **Source HTML** panel even for very large documents. This makes
<%= pne %> a very good standalone HTML editor in its own right.
However some complex documents, especially those that load a lot of external
resources, can cause the **Browser Preview** to behave sluggishly (after all,
it tries to update after every keystroke).

If you experience such issues, consider adjusting the **Browser Preview
Throttle** setting on the **Advanced** page of **Preferences**. This setting
can ensure that the **Browser Preview** _won’t_ update instantly with every
keystroke, but at a more moderate frequency.
