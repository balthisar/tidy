==============================

The **Tidy Messages** table is your best resource for understanding the actions
that <%= pne %> performed on your document. As shown below, it consists of one
or more rows of information, divided into multiple columns of data. As a
standard <%= mac_os %> table, the columns can be sorted, repositioned, and
re-sized.

![messages](all-docpart-messages)

**Severity**

 : The severity indicates the general type of condition that
   <%= pne %> encountered, and can be one of the following types.

   - _Information_ presents general information.
   - _Warning_ indicates that something isnâ€™t an error, but most likely a serious problem anyway.
   - _Configuration_ indicates a configuration problem, and should be very rare in <%= pne %>.
   - _Access_ messages are given when accessibility issues are discovered.
   - _Error_ messages indicate that the source violates a specification or uses unsupported features.
   - _Document_ indicates that the issue is related to something in the document structure.
   - _PANIC!_ indicates the Tidy had an internal error, and you should file a bug report if encountered.

**Location**

 : The location, if present, indicates the row and column position in the Source
   HTML of the cause of the message. Selecting a row in the table will move the
   Source HTML editor to this location automatically, and highlight the location
   for you.

**Message Description**

 : The description describes the condition that was found. This important
   information is key to understanding what changes Tidy made. Depending on
   your [reasons for using <%= pne %>][use_cases] you may choose
   to ignore the message, or you might take steps to fix the issue in the
   **Source HTML**.

Filtering Message Types
-----------------------

If you are working on documents with several errors and warnings, it may be
useful to concentrate on only certain message types at a time. You can display
the mess type filter by choosing **Filter Tidy Messages** in the Action menu on
the bottom, left hand side of the Tidy Messages table.

![tidy messages action menu](all-action-messages)

The filter controls will become visible at the bottom of the Tidy Messages
panel, as shown:

![tidy message type filter](all-docpart-messagefilter)

Use the standard <%= mac_os %> scope buttons to select only the messages types
that you would like to see.

The button titles indicate in parentheses the number of messages of that type,
if any.
