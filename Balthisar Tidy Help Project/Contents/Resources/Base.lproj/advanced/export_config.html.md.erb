==============================

One of the benefits of having _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ is its added ability to
help you work more efficiently with command line Tidy.

Command line Tidy (on all platforms) can use a configuration file to affect how
it generates output. Now that you’ve done the hard work of discovering your
perfect settings using _Balthisar Tidy_, you can export a configuration file
for use with command line Tidy. Follow the steps below to learn how, and
consider reading the discussion that follows.

<div class="steps" markdown="1">

1. From either the **Tidy** panel in **Preferences** or from any open
   document, select the menu at the bottom of the **Tidy Options** list and
   find the **Export a Unix config file with these options…** menu choice.
   ![context menu][context-options-pro]

2. _Balthisar Tidy_ will present a standard file saving dialog. Although a
   suggested name is given, command line Tidy doesn’t care about filenames or
   extensions.

3. To use the options file with command line Tidy, invoke command line Tidy
   like this: \\
   `tidy -config configfile.cfg dirtyfile.html`

<h1>Discussion</h1>

_Balthisar Tidy_ does not supply a version of command line Tidy, but it is
installed by default on Mac OS X computers and easily available for Linux and
Unix distributions, and an installer is available for Windows.

_Balthisar Tidy_ uses a cutting-edge version of Tidy. It’s more advanced than
all current pre-built Tidy versions. This generally means that command line Tidy
will fail to handle conditions that _Balthisar Tidy_ handles correctly, such as
simple HTML5. On Mac OS X, _Balthisar Tidy for Work_’s support for automation
technologies (such as AppleScript) can permit you to use the latest Tidy
technology without sacrificing your automated workflow.

If your HTML and XML files use legacy character encodings, e.g., if they are not
UTF8, please double-check the configuration file that _Balthisar Tidy_ exports
in order to ensure that it includes the correct legacy Tidy `input-encoding`
and `output-encoding` values for your files. _Balthisar Tidy_ supports _every_
Mac OS X character encoding, whereas command line Tidy _does not_.
