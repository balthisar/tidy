==============================

<%= product_name %> offers one or more Mac OS X System Services, depending on
your version of Mac OS X.

**Tidy selection in new Balthisar Tidy document**
 : This Service starts _<%= product_name %>_ (if it’s not already started) and
   creates a new, untitled document with the selected text.

   This Service is available on all versions of Mac OS X on which
   _<%= product_name %>_ runs.

**Tidy selection using Balthisar Tidy**
 : Using the **Preferences** from _<%= product_name %>_, this service will
   perform Tidying in place. You don’t even have to start <%= product_name %> to
   use it.

   Because of Apple's sandbox security system, this System Service is only
   available on Mac OS X 10.9 and above.

How to Use System Services
--------------------------

When _<%= product_name %>_’s Services are enabled (see below), they can be used
from nearly any Mac OS X application. Simply select the text that you would like
to use the service on, and then use the **Application** menu (for example, in
_BBEdit_, the Application menu is called **BBEdit**), **Services** submenu. The
list of apple Services will appear in the menu, as shown here:

![Services Menu Sample][menu-services]

If _<%= product_name %>_’s Services do not appear, then you will have to set
them up first.


Setting up System Services
--------------------------

It’s important to start _<%= product_name %>_ at least one time before setting
up Services. This allows Mac OS X to know that _<%= product_name %>_ is able to
provide Services.

You configure _<%= product_name %>_’s Services in the **System Preferences**
application using the **Keyboard** control panel as highlighted below.

![System Preferences][setup-preferences]

Alternatively you can use the **Services Preferences…** shortcut in an
application services menu as illustrated in the previous section.

In **System Preferences**, **Keyboard** control panel, **Shortcuts** pane,
**Services** item in the list, you can see all of the installed Services and
enable them with the corresponding check box, as shown here.
