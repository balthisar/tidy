==============================

<%= product_name %> offers one or more Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X System Services, 
depending on your version of Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X.

**Tidy selection in new Balthisar Tidy document**
 : This Service starts _<%= product_name %>_ (if it’s not already started) and
   creates a new, untitled document with the selected text.

   This Service is available on all versions of Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X on which
   _<%= product_name %>_ runs.

**Tidy selection with Balthisar Tidy**
 : Using the **Preferences** from _<%= product_name %>_, this service will
   perform Tidying in place. You don’t even have to start <%= product_name %> to
   use it. Note that this service will always produce a full HTML document, ignoring
   the `show-body-only` setting in **Preferences**.

**Tidy selection with Balthisar Tidy (body only)**
 : Using the **Preferences** from _<%= product_name %>_, this service will
   perform Tidying in place. You don’t even have to start <%= product_name %> to
   use it. This service is convenient for tidying snippets of code without producing
   a complete HTML document.

   Note that _<%= product_name %>_ has no idea of your file’s original indentation;
   _<%= product_name %>_ will return indented text (if configured to do so), but its
   base indentation will be zero. You may have to use your application’s block indent
   feature once your text is tidy'd.


How to Use System Services
--------------------------

When _<%= product_name %>_’s Services are enabled (see below), they can be used
from nearly any Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X application. Simply select the text that you would like
to use the service on, and then use the **Application** menu (for example, in
_BBEdit_, the Application menu is called **BBEdit**), **Services** submenu. The
list of apple Services will appear in the menu, as shown here:

![Services Menu Sample][all-menu-services]

If _<%= product_name %>_’s Services do not appear, then you will have to set
them up first.


Setting up System Services
--------------------------

It’s important to start _<%= product_name %>_ at least one time before setting
up Services. This allows Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X to know that _<%= product_name %>_ is able to
provide Services.

You configure _<%= product_name %>_’s Services in the **System Preferences**
application using the **Keyboard** control panel as highlighted below.

![System Preferences][all-setup-preferences]

Alternatively you can use the **Services Preferences…** shortcut in an
application services menu as illustrated in the previous section.

In **System Preferences**, **Keyboard** control panel, **Shortcuts** pane,
**Services** item in the list, you can see all of the installed Services and
enable them with the corresponding check box, as shown here.
