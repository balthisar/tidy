==============================

<%= product_name %> offers its code cleanup and pretty printing facilities as
an Action Extension on Mac OS X 10.10 and above.

**Tidy with Balthisar Tidy**
 : This Action uses the **Preferences** in _<%= product_name %>_ to Tidy your
   selected text in place. There is no need to start _<%= product_name %>_.

   This Action Extension is only available on Mac OS X 10.10 and above.


How to Use Actions
------------------

When _<%= product_name %>_’s Extension is enabled (see below), it can be used
from nearly any Mac OS X application that supports Action Extensions. Simply
select the text that you would like to use the Extension on, and then hover over
the text until a small, popup indicator appears at the end of the selected text,
as shown here in this sample for **TextEdit**.

![Extension Popup][action-invoke]

You can activate the popup menu to reveal all of the applicable Extensions for
the current context, as shown here.

![Extension Popup Items][action-menu]

If _<%= product_name %>_’s Extension does not appear, then you will have to set
it up first.


Setting up Extensions
---------------------

It’s important to start _<%= product_name %>_ at least one time before setting
up Extensions. This allows Mac OS X to know that _<%= product_name %>_ is able
to provide Extensions.

You configure _<%= product_name %>_’s Extension in the **System Preferences**
application using the **Extensions** control panel as highlighted below.

![System Preferences][setup-preferences]

Alternatively you can use the **More…** shortcut in an
application Action Extension menu as illustrated in the previous section.

In **System Preferences**, **Extensions** control panel, **All** item in the
list, you can see all of the installed Services and enable them with the
corresponding check box, as shown here.
