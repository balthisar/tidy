==============================

_<%= product_name %>_ offers its code cleanup and pretty printing facilities as
an Action Extension.

**Tidy with Balthisar Tidy**
 : This Action uses the **Preferences** in _<%= product_name %>_ to Tidy your
   selected text in place. There is no need to start _<%= product_name %>_. This
   extension will always produce a complete document, regardless of the `show-body-only`
   setting in **Preferences**.

**Tidy with Balthisar Tidy (body only)**
 : This Action uses the **Preferences** in _<%= product_name %>_ to Tidy your
   selected text in place. There is no need to start _<%= product_name %>_. This
   extension is useful for tidying snippets of code without producing a complete
   HTML document.

   Note that _<%= product_name %>_ has no idea of your file’s original indentation;
   _<%= product_name %>_ will return indented text (if configured to do so), but its
   base indentation will be zero. You may have to use your application’s block indent
   feature once your text is tidy'd.


How to Use Actions
------------------

When _<%= product_name %>_’s Extension is enabled (see below), it can be used
from nearly any Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X application that supports Action Extensions.
Simply select the text that you would like to use the Extension on, and then 
hover over the text until a small, popup indicator appears at the end of the
selected text, as shown here in this sample for **TextEdit**.

![Extension Popup][all-action-invoke]

You can activate the popup menu to reveal all of the applicable Extensions for
the current context, as shown here.

![Extension Popup Items][all-action-menu]

If _<%= product_name %>_’s Extension does not appear, then you will have to set
it up first.


Setting up Extensions
---------------------

It’s important to start _<%= product_name %>_ at least one time before setting
up Extensions. This allows Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X to know that _<%= product_name %>_
is able to provide Extensions.

You configure _<%= product_name %>_’s Extension in the **System Preferences**
application using the **Extensions** control panel as highlighted below.

![System Preferences][all-setup-preferences]

Alternatively you can use the **More…** shortcut in an
application Action Extension menu as illustrated in the previous section.

In **System Preferences**, **Extensions** control panel, **Actions** item in the
list, you can see all of the installed Services and enable them with the
corresponding check box, as shown here.
