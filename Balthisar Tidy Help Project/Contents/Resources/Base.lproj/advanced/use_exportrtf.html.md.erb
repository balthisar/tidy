==============================

_<%= product_name %>_ can export Rich Text (RTF) versions of the text in the
**Tidy HTML** editor pane. This is most useful when 
[syntax highlighting][docwin-syntaxhighlighting] is enabled, of course.

This exported file is suitable for use in situations where syntax colored,
Tidy-formatted text is desired for non-HTTP applications, such as for code
review purposes.

To export an RTF file, simply select the **Export as RTF…** menu item in the
application’s **File** menu, as demonstrated below.

![file menu][pro-menu-file]

You will then be presented with a standard Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X file save dialog.
