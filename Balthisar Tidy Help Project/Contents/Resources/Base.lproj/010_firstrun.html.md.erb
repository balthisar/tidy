==============================

The first time you start <%= pne %>, <%= mac_os %> may ask for your permission
to run _Balthisar Tidy Service Helper_ as shown in the picture below. If you
plan to use <%= pne %>’s [System Services][service], then you should allow this
action by choosing **Open**.

![helper-startup](all-helper-startup)

Explanation
-----------
This permission request is the result of design decisions to make your life
better:

- <%= pne %> is sandboxed, meaning that it can only run with privileges you
  assign and cannot interfere with the rest of your operating system.
  
- Some of <%= pne %>’s System Services are run as background processes so that
  <%= pne %> application doesn’t have to startup and run every time you want to
  use a Service.
  
<% if target_feature?(:feature_supports_applescript) %>
-  <%= pne %>’s most useful AppleScript properties are delivered by the
  background process, meaning you don't have to wait for the entire application
  to load in order to use them.
<% end %>

Some important information about this background application:

- _Balthisar Tidy Service Helper_ is **not** running all the time in the
  background.
  
- It is loaded as-needed by <%= mac_os %>.

- It is also launched and then immediately quit whenever you start <%= pne %>.
  
- This ensures that <%= mac_os %> knows about the helper and will use it
  when you request it from other application.

Note that because <%= mac_os %> is protecting you, if you move, rename, or
update <%= pne %>, then <%= mac_os %> may ask for your confirmation again.
