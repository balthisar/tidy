==============================

The first time you open _<%= product_name %>_, Mac OS X may ask for your
permission to run _Balthisar Tidy Service Helper_ as shown in the picture
below. If you plan to use _<%= product_name %>_’s [System Services][service],
then you should allow this action by choosing **Open**.

![helper-startup][helper-startup]

Explanation
-----------
This permission request is the result of two design decisions to make your life
better:

- _<%= product_name %>_ is sandboxed, meaning that it can only run with
  privileges you assign and cannot interfere with the rest of your operating
  system.
- Some of _<%= product_name %>_’s System Services are run as background
  processes so that _<%= product_name %>_ application doesn’t have to startup
  and run every time you want to use a Service.

Note that because Mac OS X is protecting you, if you move _<%= product_name %>_
or rename it, then Mac OS X will ask for your confirmation again.
