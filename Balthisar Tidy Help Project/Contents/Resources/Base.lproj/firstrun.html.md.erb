==============================

The first time you start _<%= product_name %>_, Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X may ask for your
permission to run _Balthisar Tidy Service Helper_ as shown in the picture
below. If you plan to use _<%= product_name %>_’s [System Services][service],
then you should allow this action by choosing **Open**.

![helper-startup][all-helper-startup]

Explanation
-----------
This permission request is the result of two design decisions to make your life
better:

- _<%= product_name %>_ is sandboxed, meaning that it can only run with
  privileges you assign and cannot interfere with the rest of your operating
  system.
- Some of _<%= product_name %>_’s System Services are run as background
  processes so that _<%= product_name %>_ application doesn’t have to startup
  and run every time you want to use a Service.
<% if target_feature?(:feature_supports_applescript) %>
-  _<%= product_name %>_’s most useful AppleScript properties are delivered by
  the background process, meaning you don't have to wait for the entire
  application to load in order to use them.
<% end %>

Note that because Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X is protecting you, if you move _<%= product_name %>_
or rename it, then Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X will ask for your confirmation again.
