  This template is suitable for general pages within a group, as it makes
  navigation between the different pages in the group obvious and easy. It
  features a medium version of your logo on the right, followed by navigation
  to the other pages in the group. Optionally :seeAlso content can follow the
  related pages.

  It will normally use the standard layout-html4 layout which is required for
  all of your help pages except for the main landing page. If you include
  `xhtml: true` in any page’s frontmatter then it will be built using the
  layout-xhtml layout instead. You shouldn’t do so, however.
