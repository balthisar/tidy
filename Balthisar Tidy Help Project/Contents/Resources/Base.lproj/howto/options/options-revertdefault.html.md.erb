==============================

You may find yourself using _Balthisar Tidy_’s **Tidy Options** panel to work
with a document to determine the options that you want, and then realize that
you went just too far and need a fresh start. Learn how to reset the current
options back to the Preferences defaults in just three quick steps.

<div class="steps" markdown="1">

1. Access the menu at the bottom of the **Tidy Options** panel in the document
   that you want to reset.
   <% if target_feature?(:feature_exports_config) %>
   ![options context menu][context-options-pro]
   <% else %>
   ![options context menu][context-options]
   <% end %>

2. Select **Reset options to defaults in Preferences**.

3. You should see that all of the Tidy options have reverted to their default
   states.
