==============================

By default _Balthisar Tidy_ will group all Tidy options according to their
function. These groups will be sorted according to your computer’s language
settings, and the options within in each group will be sorted the same way.

Additionally, by default _Balthisar Tidy_ will use the Unix Tidy names for
each of the Tidy options, as these are the names that most long time Tidy
users are familiar with.

To learn how to change these settings, please read these few simple steps.

<div class="steps" markdown="1">

1. You can choose **Show friendly option names** and choose **Show options in
   groups** using the menu at the bottom of the **Tidy Options** panel.
   <% if target_feature?(:feature_exports_config) %>
   ![menu][context-options-pro]
   <% else %>
   ![menu][context-options]
   <% end %>
   Choosing these options affects only the current window.

2. You can choose default behaviour for new windows in [Preferences][prefs-tidyappearance].

3. **Friendly option names** are meant to help better describe the purpose of
   each Tidy option. In same cases there is no difference except for
   capitalization. Local language versions of _Balthisar Tidy_ will have names
   that are as friendly as possible in the local language.

4. When options are not shown in groups, they will be shown according to the
   sorting rules for you computer’s locale. In alphabet-using regions this will
   generally be localized alphabetical order.
