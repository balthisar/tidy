==============================

The **Browser Preview** panel can provide immediate feedback on how well your
page renders in a web browser. Use this preview in order to have confidence that
<%= product_name %> isn’t breaking your code.

Follow these steps to become acquainted with the **Browser Preview**.

<div class="steps" markdown="1">

1. Ensure that the tab **Browser Preview** is selected in the panel at the bottom
   of the document window.

2. Observe the preview. Because it <%= product_name %> uses Safari, your web
   page should draw the Tidy’d text identically to the Safari browser.

3. If your page loads resources such as CSS or images, you will want to specify
   a base URL. You can do so in the standard Action menu at the bottom of the
   **Browser Preview** panel.
   
4. You can explore other options in the Action menu, too.
