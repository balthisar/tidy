==============================

You can work much closer to _<%= product_name %>_â€™s messages by displaying
them in the line number gutter and having their locations marked directly in
your source document.

<div class="steps" markdown="1">

1. First make sure that the gutter is visible by using the **Gutter** menu
   item of the **Source Code** submenu of the **View** menu.
   ![source code submenu][all-menu-view-sourcecode]
   
2. Also make sure that **Show Errors** is enabled in the **Editor** pane of
   **Preferences**.
   ![editor pane][all-tidy-prefs-Editor].

2. If your document contains errors or generates Tidy messages, you will see
   an icon representing the error level of the most severe error on that line
   in the line number gutter.
   ![source editor][all-docpart-source]

3. Clicking on a message icon will reveal a list of Tidy messages with a
   corresponding icon indicating the error level for each message.
   ![gutter message example][all-message-gutter]
   
4. Note that if there is only one error on the line, then an icon will not
   appear for that error item, as it would be redundant.

</div>
