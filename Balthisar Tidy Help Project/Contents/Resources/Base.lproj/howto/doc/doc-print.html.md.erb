==============================

<div class="steps" markdown="1">
1. To print your Tidy’d source code, Use the **Print** menu item in the **File**
   menu.
   ![file menu][all-menu-file]

2. Use all of the standard Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X features for your particular printer. You
   will also have the ability to save as a PDF.
</div>

***Note***: _<%= product_name %>_ will honor all of your Tidy options, including
settings such as `wrap`. If you have very long lines and `wrap` is 0 (meaning no
wrap at all) or is set to a very high value, then _<%= product_name %>_ will
shrink the output in order to accomodate the page size. This may result in very
tiny text.
