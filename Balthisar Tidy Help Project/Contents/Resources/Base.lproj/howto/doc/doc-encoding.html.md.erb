==============================

When _Balthisar Tidy_ opens a document, it tries to use the Tidy option
`input-encoding` in [Preferences][prefs-tidyoptions]. The typical
modern practice is to use UTF-8 encoding for all files, however there are many
legacy file encoding formats from different countries and different
operating systems. *Balthisar Tidy* supports *every* encoding offered by
Mac OS X.

There is no tried and true way to determine the encoding format for most
formats. For the most part, *Balthisar Tidy* will assume that you, the
user, know what you are doing.

In same cases, though, it’s obvious that the `input-encoding`
is wrong. In these few cases, and when the [correct preference][prefs-misc] is
selected, Tidy will offer you the chance to change the encoding format,
as shown below.

Tidy’s criterion for success is whether opening the document yields any
text at all. As indicated in the warning, it’s still possible that the
`input-encoding` is incorrect. You should examine the **Source
HTML** (not the **Tidy HTML**!) to verify that the correct
`input-encoding` is selected. If some non-Western characters
still look incorrect, you can manually choose the correct
`input-encoding` from the [Tidy Options][docwin-chooseoptions] pane. If
you use this `input-encoding`, you can also set it as the default in
*Balthisar Tidy*’s [Preferences][prefs-tidyoptions].
