    document using the Tidy’d text.
   ![file menu][menu-file]

2. If an alert dialog appears on screen, take an appropriate action per the

Discussion
----------

Saving your document will replace the original document, and so, depending on
the behavior set in [Preferences][prefs-filesaving], you may have to use the
**Save As…** menu item in the **File** menu to save your document. If
you attempt to save a document and see this message:

![alert window][save-save-as-required]

Or this message:

![alert window][save-save-warning]

…then you can be sure that *Balthisar Tidy* is set to ensure against any
possible data loss as a result of its work.

Data loss is very unlikely, but as Tidy is very, very strict it’s possible that
it will remove content that it thinks is garbage. For this reason it’s always
important to [review the Tidy Messages table][docwin-messages].
