Although you’re always welcome to email us at [balthisar@balthisar.com][1] or
communicate with us at [Twitter][2], may we suggest you also consider the
following options?

- Ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version of <%= pne %>.
  <% if target_feature?(:feature_sparkle) %>
  Use **Check for Updates…** in the **Balthisar Tidy** main menu. You may also
  consider enabling automatic update checking in **Preferences**.
  <% else %>
  Check the **App Store** to ensure that there are no pending updates awaiting
  your approval. The **App Store** can be setup to download all updates
  automatically.
  <% end %>

- Check <%= pne %>’s [FAQs][3].

- Have a look at <%= pne %>’s [support page][4], which always has
  up-to-date support information.

- Visit our bug tracker and feature request issues list at [github][5].
  This system will make it easy for you to share your problems with other users
  and provide up-to-the-date information about the status of your requests.

- If there are issues with the Tidy’ing itself, these bugs are best reported
  to [HTACG][7]’s issues list at [github][6].
  
- If the Validator seems to be giving incorrect results, these bugs should be
  reported to the Validator team’s [issues list at github][9].
