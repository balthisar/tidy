==============================

Tidy’s many options are what allow you to diagnose your source HTML, and
they control the output options such as formatting.

1. Tidy offers many options for cleaning your HTML, correcting errors, identifying
   accessibility issues, and more. All of the available options are available in
   the document window pane labeled **Tidy&nbsp;Options**, as shown to the left.

2. Choose Tidy options using the mouse. Depending on your
   [Preferences Settings][prefs-tidyappearance] the standard <%= mac_os %> controls
   will be invisible until you hover over them with the mouse.

3. <%= pne %> makes it easy for keyboard users to choose options,
   too. When the list of options is focused (by either clicking into it our
   using the `tab` key), you can move up and down the list with the up- and
   down-arrow keyboard keys.

4. You can also use the left- and right-arrow keyboard keys to select option
   values for most of <em>Balthisar Tidy</em>’s settings. And of course you
   will see the results in the **Tidy HTML** view immediately!
