<%= current_page.data.title %>
==============================

<%= pne %> can import a configuration file used by command line Tidy.
Follow the steps below to learn how.

<div class="steps" markdown="1">

1. From either the **Tidy** panel in **Preferences** or from any open
   document, select the menu at the bottom of the **Tidy Options** list and
   find the **Import settings from a Unix config file…** menu choice.
   ![context menu](all-menu-context-options)

2. <%= pne %> will present a standard file open dialog. Simply choose
   the configuration file that you would like to use and open it. Note that
   command line Tidy doesn’t force particular extensions, and so you may choose
   files having any extension.

</div>

Note that just like HTML Tidy from the command line, <%= pne %> will
only apply the settings from the configuration file against Tidy’s factory
default settings. This means that if your configuration file specifies _only_
`wrap` (for example), then importing this file will set all of the other Tidy
Options to their factory defaults, and then apply the `wrap` setting. This
ensures that <%= pne %>’s behavior is identical to HTML Tidy’s.
