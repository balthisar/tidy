==============================

This brief walkthrough will help you get started using _<%= product_name %>_
right away. In it, you will “Tidy” a document.

First, make sure you have an HTML file that you would like to Tidy. If you don’t
have a file, then feel free to copy the text below, and you	can paste it into
Tidy when we get started.

~~~~~ html
<h1>Hello, World!</h3>
<p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
<a href="#"><div>Sometimes valid, sometimes now.</div></a>
<p>Some elements are <b>deprecated</b> in HTML, and they should
   be replaced by <i>other</i> elements.
</p>
<p>I hope that someday, <em><strong>everything</em></strong> will come
   to fruition!
</p>

In this walkthrough, we will Tidy some source HTML and you will gain
a good overview of how _<%= product_name %>_ works. Make sure that
_<%= product_name %>_ is running.

1. **If you have an HTML file that you would like to Tidy**:
   [Open it][doc-open] it now from the **File** menu. If Tidy has
   trouble opening the file, then the [file encoding helper][doc-encoding]
   may appear in the document window.

2. **If you are going to paste the sample as described above**:
   An empty Tidy document should already be open. Paste the code
   that you copied above into the text area labeled **Source HTML**.
   You can [learn more][doc-view_edit] about this text area, too.

3. Observe the text in the area labeled **Tidy HTML**. Compare it with
   the text in the **Source HTML** area. In many cases you will see some
   significant differences. If you use the sample text above, you may
   be impressed at the well-formed result. You can
   [learn more][doc-view_tidyd] about this text area, too.

4. Take note of any messages in the area labeled **Tidy Messages.** If
   errors are found in your document, Tidy will correct most of them
   automatically and inform you about the changes here. You can
   [learn more][docwin-messages] about this message area, too.

5. Feel free to experiment with the Tidy options in the **Tidy Options**
   area of the document window, and notice how changes affect the
   **Tidy HTML**. You can learn how to understand the meaning of these
   options in [Tidy Options][docwin-chooseoptions].

6. You can pre-set Tidy options in _<%= product_name %>_’s
   [Preferences][prefs-tidyoptions].

7. At this point you can **Save As…** your HTML document if you like. Because
   Tidy modifies your data, _<%= product_name %>_ can implement some
   measure of protection when you [save a document][doc-save].

</div>

Congratulations! You now understand the basic workflow and options that
_<%= product_name %>_ has to offer!
