==============================

_Balthisar Tidy_ source code is released as a whole under the MIT license, which
is duplicated below for your reference. Please note that **portions** of the
source code were written by others, and some of their code was released under
other ([but compatible and similar](ack_opensource.html)) licenses.

Contributions to _Balthisar Tidy_ will only be accepted if you acknowledge that
your contributions are public domain or licensed per the MIT license. Github
pull requests will be considered implicit acceptance of the MIT license and as
part of the greater corpus of work, **balthisar.com** and/or Jim Derry will
assume copyright ownership. In general, though, **balthisar.com** and/or
Jim Derry will contact the contributor of transformative pull requests prior to
accepting them in order to clarify licensing requirements. For example,
_Balthisar Tidy_ incorporates components licensed separately for which we do
not claim ownership. _The intention of this is to protect you as an author
while at the same time not worrying about punctuation changes and bug fixes._

Also please note that while the source code is completely free, the branding
and artwork have some restrictions, as noted below.

Trademark and Artwork Policy
----------------------------

This text does not constitute a license; it is meant to clarify a general
policy regarding certain intellectual property, copyrights, and trademarks
that belong to Balthisar and/or Jim Derry.

"Balthisar Tidy™" is currently in commerce use to describe a software product
for personal computers that performs operations on files. This trademark is
used stylistically as "Balthisar Tidy."

"Balthisar™" is currently in commerce use to distinguish products, services, and
written content via electronic and other media. This trademark is used
stylistically as "balthisar," "balthisar.com," and "www.balthisar.com."

The entirety of _Balthisar Tidy_ is Copyright ©2003-2014 by Jim Derry. The
source code (including HTML files that constitute the Apple Help system) has
been released under the MIT License. Although you may use the source code for
any purpose allowed by the license, you may not use Jim Derry's artwork or
trademarks for any commercial purpose without explicit, personal permission. You
may not represent forks or other distributions (including binary distributions)
as having originated directly from balthisar.com or Jim Derry.

### Examples

You may choose to maintain the Balthisar artwork only if you maintain the
Balthisar branding.

You may choose to maintain the Balthisar branding. Forks that maintain Balthisar
branding must clearly indicate that they are forks in any public repository and
any publicly available binary. Github, for example, clearly indicates this
status on your behalf. You should modify the copyright information in the header
files to indicate additional copyright information for the changes you
introduce.

Binary distributions may use Balthisar branding and artwork, but it must be
obvious to the user that the application is a non-original version. For example,
"Bob's Improved Balthisar Tidy," or "YA Balthisar Tidy" make it clear that the
product origin is not balthisar.com or Jim Derry.

Binary distributions that completely remove all Balthisar branding and artwork
are perfectly acceptable, even if for sale. This is your right under the MIT
License. The MIT license does not extend to the Balthisar brands and artwork,
however.
