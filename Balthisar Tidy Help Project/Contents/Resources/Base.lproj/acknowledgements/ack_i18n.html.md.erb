Help Us Help You!
-----------------

_Balthisar Tidy_ is used around the world, so why not help us make it available
in _your_ native language?

Those of us at **balthisar.com** speak a couple of languages in addition to
English, but the quality isn’t nearly enough for our high standards for quality
software.

_Balthisar Tidy_ is completely free of charge, and _Balthisar Tidy for Work_’s
primary purpose is to earn money for professional translation, but with a niche
product like _Balthisar Tidy_ you can imagine that the volumes won’t support
more than a single language, or perhaps two. So what can you do, if you’re so
inclined?


### Help out!

The source code to _Balthisar Tidy_ is on
[github](https://github.com/balthisar/tidy). Have a look at the repository,
choose a language, and help make _Balthisar Tidy_ yours.

### Buy _Balthisar Tidy for Work_

As mentioned earlier, _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ is primarily intended as an
avenue for pursuing funding for language localization. While we‘re happy to
swallow the costs of distributing _Balthisar Tidy_ free of charge, language
translation is just too expensive for that.

Priority for translations goes by _Balthisar Tidy for Work_’s sales volumes in
each language reason, so convince your friends to buy, too.

And remember, _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ dangles a couple of advanced features to
further encourage the investment.
