This is an advertisement. It’s fairly unobtrusive and hidden in a help file,

product: _Balthisar Tidy for Work_.

Here’s The Intellectual Incentive
---------------------------------
_Balthisar Tidy for Work_ gives you all of the great features of _Balthisar
Tidy_ with a few extra goodies to make it worth it:

**AppleScript support**
 : Leverage the automation that AppleScript enables and introduce _Balthisar
   Tidy for Work_ into your complex projects.

**Generate Command Line Configuration Files**
 : _Balthisar Tidy_ has a great UI, but sometimes you need to use command line
   Tidy as part of your workflow. Why not let _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ help you
   by using its superb GUI to develop your settings, and exporting them into a

**Top Secret, In-Development Features**

And Here’s the Emotional Appeal
-------------------------------
_Balthisar Tidy_ and _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ are fun products to work on, and
fun and pride in craftsmanship is really our chief motivation at
**balthisar.com**.

**Our primary motivation to charge for <em>Balthisar Tidy For Work</em> is to
pay for language localization.**

_Balthisar Tidy_ is free and always will be (in fact, it’s free and open
source). Sure, some of the development tools cost money and distribution in the
App Store requires a yearly, paid membership, but these are relatively low costs
that contribute to our enjoyment. But language localization is expensive, much
too expensive to eat out of pocket.

So, here’s the deal: 100% of the net proceeds from _Balthisar Tidy for Work_
will be used to pay for language localizations, prioritized by the number of
sales in each language region.

And, hey, if you already speak English and don’t care about the Latvians, then
consider purchasing _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ on its merits alone.
