product: _Balthisar Tidy for Work_.

    the colors used to syntax highlight your code. Even better you can assign
    these color combinations to custom themes and change them at will. Several
    attractive themes are already included in _Balthisar Tidy for Work_.

**AppleScript support**

   Tidy for Work_ into your complex projects.

**Export Tidy’d output as rich text**

And Here’s the Emotional Appeal
-------------------------------
_Balthisar Tidy_ and _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ are fun products to work on, and
fun and pride in craftsmanship is really our chief motivation at
**balthisar.com**.

**Our primary motivation to charge for <em>Balthisar Tidy For Work</em> is to
pay for language localization.**

_Balthisar Tidy_ is free and always will be (in fact, it’s free and open
source). Sure, some of the development tools cost money and distribution in the
App Store requires a yearly, paid membership, but these are relatively low costs
that contribute to our enjoyment. But language localization is expensive, much
too expensive to eat out of pocket.

So, here’s the deal: 100% of the net proceeds from _Balthisar Tidy for Work_
will be used to pay for language localizations, prioritized by the number of
sales in each language region.

And, hey, if you already speak English and don’t care about the Latvians, then
consider purchasing _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ on its merits alone.
