==============================

If you’re a long time command line Tidy user, you may find that some option that
you’re accustomed to using seems to be missing from _<%= product_name %>_. This
section will explain why they appear to be missing, workarounds, and
explanations.

_<%= product_name %>_ isn’t a rewrite of Tidy; it uses the same code as
traditional command line Tidy, and supports _all_ of Tidy’s options, in some
cases replacing them with Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X’s superior implementation.

This summary should provide an explanation for the differences between Tidy’s
options and _<%= product_name %>_’s options.

`char-encoding`
 : _<%= product_name %>_ hides this option in favor of handling `input-encoding` and
  `output-encoding` separately. The main motivation for this is to take advantage
  of Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X’s vast array of file encoding options compared to the limited options
  offered by Tidy proper.

`language`
 : _<%= product_name %>_ provides superior localization to traditional Tidy, and
   no Tidy output is used directly, anyway, making this option literally useless.

`doctype-mode`
 : Although sometimes command line Tidy will accept setting this option, it’s
   officially defined as “read-only” by Tidy’s application programming interface.
   _<%= product_name %>_ supports `doctype` as it should.

`hide-endtags`
 : This option is a synonym for `omit-optional-tags`, and so
   _<%= product_name %>_ hides this option.

`slide-style`
`split`
 : These two options are marked as obsolete in Tidy’s source code, and so they
   will not be supported by _<%= product_name %>_.

`drop-font-tags`
 : This option is marked as obsolete in Tidy’s source code, and it’s dangerous
   to use besides. As such it will not be supported by _<%= product_name %>_.


`error-file`
`gnu-emacs`
`gnu-emacs-file`
`keep-time`
`output-bom`
`output-file`
`quiet`
`show-error`
`show-info`
`show-warnings`
`write-back`
 : These are all options that apply to command line Tidy only, and/or are handled
   directly by _<%= product_name %>_.
