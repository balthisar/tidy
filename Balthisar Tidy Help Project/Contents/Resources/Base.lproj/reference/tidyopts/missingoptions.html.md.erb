==============================

If you’re a long time command line Tidy user, you may find that some option that
you’re accustomed to using seems to be missing from _Balthisar Tidy_. This
section will explain why they appear to be missing, workarounds, and
explanations.

_Balthisar Tidy_ isn’t a rewrite of Tidy; it uses the same code as traditional
command line Tidy, and supports _all_ of Tidy’s options, in some cases replacing
them with Mac OS X’s superior implementation.

This summary should provide an explanation for the differences between Tidy’s
options and _Balthisar Tidy_’s options.

`char-encoding`
 : _Balthisar Tidy_ hides this option in favor of handling `input-encoding` and
  `output-encoding` separately. The main motivation for this is to take advantage
  of Mac OS X’s vast array of file encoding options compared to the limited options
  offered by Tidy proper.

`language`
 : _Balthisar Tidy_ provides superior localization to traditional Tidy, and no
   Tidy output is used directly, anyway, making this option literally useless.

`doctype-mode`
 : Although sometimes command line Tidy will accept setting this option, it’s
   officially defined as “read-only” by Tidy’s application programming interface.
   _Balthisar Tidy_ supports `doctype` as it should.

`hide-endtags`
 : This option is a synonym for `omit-optional-tags`, and so _Balthisar Tidy_
   hides this option.

`slide-style`
`split`
 : These two options are marked as obsolete in Tidy’s source code, and so they
   will not be supported by _Balthisar Tidy_.

`error-file`
`gnu-emacs`
`gnu-emacs-file`
`keep-time`
`output-bom`
`output-file`
`quiet`
`show-error`
`show-info`
`show-warnings`
`write-back`
 : These are all options that apply to command line Tidy only, and/or are handled
   directly by _Balthisar Tidy_.
