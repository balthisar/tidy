==============================

This section contains a reference to all of _Balthisar Tidy_’s Tidy options.


`accessibility-check`
: This option specifies what level of accessibility checking, if any, that Tidy
  should do.


`add-xml-decl`
: This option specifies if Tidy should add the XML declaration when outputting
  XML or XHTML.

  Note that if the input already includes an `<?xml ... ?>` declaration then
  this option will be ignored.


`add-xml-space`
: This option specifies if Tidy should add `xml:space='preserve'` to elements
  such as `<pre>`, `<style>` and `<script>` when generating XML.

  This is needed if the whitespace in such elements is to be parsed
  appropriately without having access to the DTD.


`alt-text`
: This option specifies the default `alt=` text Tidy uses for `<img>`
  attributes.

  Use with care, as this feature suppresses further accessibility warnings.


`anchor-as-name`
: This option controls the deletion or addition of the `name` attribute in
  elements where it can serve as anchor.

  If set to **yes**, a `name` attribute, if not already existing, is added along
  an existing `id` attribute if the DTD allows it.

  If set to **no**, any existing `name` attribute is removed if an `id`
  attribute exists or has been added.


`ascii-chars`
: Can be used to modify behavior the `clean` option when set to **yes**.

  If set to **yes** when using `clean`, then `&emdash;`, `&rdquo;`, and other
  named character entities are downgraded to their closest ASCII equivalents.


`assume-xml-procins`
: This option specifies if Tidy should change the parsing of processing
  instructions to require `?>` as the terminator rather than `>`.

  This option is automatically set if the input is in XML.


`bare`
: This option specifies if Tidy should strip Microsoft specific HTML from Word
  2000 documents, and output spaces rather than non-breaking spaces where they
  exist in the input.


`break-before-br`
: This option specifies if Tidy should output a line break before each `<br>`
  element.


`clean`
: This option specifies if Tidy should strip out surplus presentational tags and
  attributes replacing them by style rules and structural markup as
  appropriate.

  It works well on the HTML saved by Microsoft Office products.


`coerce-endtags`
: This option specifies if Tidy should coerce a start tag into an end tag in
  cases where it looks like an end tag was probably intended. For example, given \\
  `<span>foo <b>bar<b> baz</span>` \\
  Tidy will output \\
  `<span>foo <b>bar</b> baz</span>`


`css-prefix`
: This option specifies the prefix that Tidy uses for styles rules.

  By default, **c** will be used.


`decorate-inferred-ul`
: This option specifies if Tidy should decorate inferred `<ul>` elements
  with some CSS markup to avoid indentation to the right.


`doctype`
: Specifies the DOCTYPE declaration generated by Tidy.

  If set to **html5** the DOCTYPE is set to `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

  If set to **omit** the output won’t contain a DOCTYPE declaration.

  If set to **auto** (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess based
  upon the contents of the document.

  If set to **strict**, Tidy will set the DOCTYPE to the HTML4 or XHTML1 strict
  DTD.

  If set to **transitional**, the DOCTYPE is set to the HTML4 or XHTML1 loose
  (transitional) DTD.


`drop-empty-elements`
: This option specifies if Tidy should discard empty elements.


`drop-empty-paras`
: This option specifies if Tidy should discard empty paragraphs.


`drop-font-tags`
: This option specifies if Tidy should discard `<font>` and `<center>`
  tags without creating the corresponding style rules. This option can be set
  independently of the `clean` option.


`drop-proprietary-attributes`
: This option specifies if Tidy should strip out proprietary attributes, such as
  Microsoft data binding attributes.


`enclose-block-text`
: This option specifies if Tidy should insert a `<p>` element to enclose
  any text it finds in any element that allows mixed content for HTML transitional
  but not HTML strict.


`enclose-text`
: This option specifies if Tidy should enclose any text it finds in the body
  element within a `<p>` element.

  This is useful when you want to take existing HTML and use it with a style
  sheet.


`escape-cdata`
: This option specifies if Tidy should convert `<![CDATA[]]>` sections to
  normal text.


`fix-backslash`
: This option specifies if Tidy should replace backslash characters `\` in URLs
  with forward slashes `/`.


`fix-bad-comments`
: This option specifies if Tidy should replace unexpected hyphens with `=`
  characters when it comes across adjacent hyphens.

  The default is **yes**.

  This option is provided for users of Cold Fusion which uses the comment
  syntax `<!--- --->`.


`fix-uri`
: This option specifies if Tidy should check attribute values that carry URIs
  for illegal characters and if such are found, escape them as HTML4 recommends.


`force-output`
: This option specifies if Tidy should produce output even if errors are
  encountered.

  Use this option with care; if Tidy reports an error, this
  means Tidy was not able to, or is not sure how to, fix the error, so the
  resulting output may not reflect your intention.


`gdoc`
: This option specifies if Tidy should enable specific behavior for cleaning up
  HTML exported from Google Docs.


`hide-comments`
: This option specifies if Tidy should print out comments.


`indent-attributes`
: This option specifies if Tidy should begin each attribute on a new line.


`indent-cdata`
: This option specifies if Tidy should indent `<![CDATA[]]>` sections.


`indent-spaces`
: This option specifies the number of spaces Tidy uses to indent content when
  indentation is enabled.


`indent`
: Specifies if Tidy should indent block-level tags.

  If set to **auto** Tidy will decide whether or not to indent the content of
  tags such as `<title>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<li>`, `<td>`, or `<p>`
  based on the content including a block-level element.

  Setting indent to **yes** can expose layout bugs in some older browsers.


`input-encoding`
: This option specifies the character encoding _Balthisar Tidy_ uses for the
  source file.


`input-xml`
: This option specifies if Tidy should use the XML parser rather than the error
  correcting HTML parser.


`join-classes`
: This option specifies if Tidy should combine class names to generate a single
  new class name if multiple class assignments are detected on an element.


`join-styles`
: This option specifies if Tidy should combine styles to generate a single new
  style if multiple style values are detected on an element.


`literal-attributes`
: This option specifies how Tidy deals with whitespace characters within
  attribute values.

  If the value is **no** Tidy normalizes attribute values by replacing any
  newline or tab with a single space, and further by replacing any contiguous
  whitespace with a single space.

  To force tidy to preserve the original, literal values of all attributes and
  ensure that whitespace within attribute values is passed through unchanged,
  set this option to **yes**.


`logical-emphasis`
: This option specifies if Tidy should replace any occurrence of `<i>` with
  `<em>` and any occurrence of `<b>` with `<strong>`. Any attributes are
  preserved unchanged.

  This option can be set independently of the `clean` and `drop-font-tags`
  options.


`lower-literals`
: This option specifies if Tidy should convert the value of an attribute that
  takes a list of predefined values to lower case.

  This is required for XHTML documents.


`markup`
: This option specifies if Tidy should generate a pretty-printed version of the
  markup. Note that Tidy won’t generate a pretty-printed version if it finds
  significant errors (see `force-output`).


`merge-divs`
: Can be used to modify behavior of `clean` when set to **yes**.

  This option specifies if Tidy should merge nested `<div>` such as
  `<div><div>…</div></div>`.

  If set to **auto** the attributes of the inner `<div>` are moved to the outer
  one. Nested `<div>` with `id` attributes are _not_ merged.

  If set to **yes** the attributes of the inner `<div>` are discarded with the
  exception of `class` and `style`.


`merge-emphasis`
: This option specifies if Tidy should merge nested `<b>` and `<i>`
  elements; for example, for the case \\
  `<b class='rtop-2'>foo <b class='r2-2'>bar</b> baz</b>` \\
  Tidy will output \\
  `<b class='rtop-2'>foo bar baz</b>`.


`merge-spans`
: Can be used to modify behavior of `clean` when set to **yes**.

  This option specifies if Tidy should merge nested `<span>` such as \\
  `<span><span>…</span></span>`.

  The algorithm is identical to the one used by `merge-divs`.


`ncr`
: This option specifies if Tidy should allow numeric character references.


`new-blocklevel-tags`
: This option specifies new block-level tags. This option takes a space or comma
  separated list of tag names.

  Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a Tidy’d file if the
  input includes previously unknown tags.

  Note you can’t change the content model for elements such as `<table>`,
  `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>`.

  This option is ignored in XML mode.


`new-empty-tags`
: This option specifies new empty inline tags. This option takes a space or
  comma separated list of tag names.

  Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a Tidy’d file if the
  input includes previously unknown tags.

  Remember to also declare empty tags as either inline or blocklevel.

  This option is ignored in XML mode.


`new-inline-tags`
: This option specifies new non-empty inline tags. This option takes a space or
  comma separated list of tag names.

  Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a Tidy’d file if the
  input includes previously unknown tags.

  This option is ignored in XML mode.


`new-pre-tags`
: This option specifies new tags that are to be processed in exactly the same
  way as HTML’s `<pre>` element. This option takes a space or comma separated
  list of tag names.

  Unless you declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a Tidy’d file if the
  input includes previously unknown tags.

  Note you can not as yet add new CDATA elements.

  This option is ignored in XML mode.


`newline`
: The default is appropriate for Mac OS X.

  Generally **CRLF** on PC-DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2; **CR** on Classic Mac OS;
  and **LF** everywhere else (Mac OS X, Unix and Linux).


`numeric-entities`
: This option specifies if Tidy should output entities other than the built-in
  HTML entities (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, and &quot;) in the numeric rather than the
  named entity form.

  Only entities compatible with the DOCTYPE declaration generated are used.

  Entities that can be represented in UTF8 are translated correspondingly.


`omit-optional-tags`
: This option specifies if Tidy should omit optional start tags and end tags
  when generating output.

  Setting this option causes all tags for the `<html>`, `<head>`}, and `<body>`
  elements to be omitted from output, as well as such end tags as `</p>`,
  `</li>`, `</dt>`, `</dd>`, `</option>`, `</tr>`, `</td>`, and `</th>`.

  This option is ignored for XML output.


`output-encoding`
: This option specifies the character encoding _Balthisar Tidy_ uses when saving
  a file.

  It’s recommended to use `Unicode (UTF-8)`.


`output-html`
: This option specifies if Tidy should generate pretty-printed output, writing
  it as HTML.


`output-xhtml`
: This option specifies if Tidy should generate pretty-printed output, writing
  it as extensible HTML.

  This option causes Tidy to set the DOCTYPE and default namespace as
  appropriate to XHTML, and will use the corrected value in ouput regardless of
  other sources.

  For XHTML, entities can be written as named or numeric entities according to
  the setting of `numeric-entities`.

  The original case of tags and attributes will be preserved regardless of other
  options.


`output-xml`
: This option specifies if Tidy should pretty-print output, writing it as
  well-formed XML.

  Any entities not defined in XML 1.0 will be written as numeric entities to
  allow them to be parsed by a XML parser.

  The original case of tags and attributes will be preserved regardless of other
  options.


`preserve-entities`
: This option specifies if Tidy should preserve the well-formed entities as
  found in the input.


`punctuation-wrap`
: This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap after some Unicode or Chinese
  punctuation characters.


`quote-ampersand`
: This option specifies if Tidy should output unadorned `&` characters as
  `&amp;`.


`quote-marks`
: This option specifies if Tidy should output `"` characters as `&quot;` as is
  preferred by some editing environments.

  The apostrophe character `'` is written out as `&#39;` since many web browsers
  don’t yet support `&apos;`.


`quote-nbsp`
: This option specifies if Tidy should output non-breaking space characters as
  entities rather than as the Unicode character value 160 (decimal).


`repeated-attributes`
: This option specifies if Tidy should keep the first or last attribute if an
  attribute is repeated, e.g. has two `align` attributes.


`replace-color`
: This option specifies if Tidy should replace numeric values in color
  attributes by HTML/XHTML color names where defined, e.g. replace **#ffffff**
  with **white**.


`show-body-only`
: This option specifies if Tidy should print only the contents of the body tag
  as an HTML fragment.

  If set to **auto** this is performed only if the body tag has been inferred.

  Useful for incorporating existing whole pages as a portion of another page.

  This option has no effect if XML output is requested.


`sort-attribute`
: This option specifies that tidy should sort attributes within an element using
  the specified sort algorithm. If set to **alpha** the algorithm is an
  ascending alphabetic sort.


`tab-size`
: This option specifies the number of columns that Tidy uses between successive
  tab stops. It is used to map tabs to spaces when reading the input.

  Tidy never outputs tabs.


`tidy-mark`
: This option specifies if Tidy should add a `meta` element to the document
  head to indicate that the document has been Tidy’d.

  Tidy won’t add a meta element if one is already present.


`uppercase-attributes`
: This option specifies if Tidy should output attribute names in upper case.

  The default is **no** which results in lower case attribute names, except for
  XML input where the original case is preserved.


`uppercase-tags`
: This option specifies if Tidy should output tag names in upper case.

  The default is **no** which results in lower case tag names, except for XML
  input where the original case is preserved.


`vertical-space`
: This option specifies if Tidy should add some empty lines for readability.


`word-2000`
: This option specifies if Tidy should go to great pains to strip out all the
  surplus stuff Microsoft Word 2000 inserts when you save Word documents as “Web
  pages.” Doesn’t handle embedded images or VML.

  You should consider using Word’s “Save As: Web Page, Filtered”.


`wrap`
: This option specifies the right margin Tidy uses for line wrapping.

  Tidy tries to wrap lines so that they do not exceed this length.

  Set wrap to **0** (zero) if you want to disable line wrapping.


`wrap-asp`
: This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained within ASP
  pseudo elements, which look like: `<%% … %>`.


`wrap-attributes`
: Specifies if Tidy should line-wrap attribute values.

  By default Tidy replaces any newline or tab with a single space and replaces
  any sequences of whitespace with a single space.

  To force Tidy to preserve the original, literal values of all attributes, and
  ensure that whitespace characters within attribute values are passed through
  unchanged, set the `literal-attributes` option to **yes**.


`wrap-jste`
: This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained within JSTE
  pseudo elements, which look like: `<# … #>`.


`wrap-php`
: This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained within PHP
  pseudo elements, which look like: `<?php … ?>`.


`wrap-script-literals`
: This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap string literals that appear in
  script attributes.

  Tidy wraps long script string literals by inserting a
  backslash character before the line break.


`wrap-sections`
: This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained within
 `<![ … ]>` section tags.
