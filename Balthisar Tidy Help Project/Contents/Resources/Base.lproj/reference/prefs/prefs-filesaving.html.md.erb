==============================

The **Saving** Preferences panel controls whether files are saved normally,
saved normally after a one-time warning, or require you to **Save As…** before
saving an opened file the first time.

<% if target_feature?(:feature_sparkle) %>
![tidy prefs panel][tidy-prefs-04]
<% else %>
![tidy prefs panel][tidy-prefs-04-ns]
<% end %>

Saving your document will replace the original document, and so, depending on
the behavior set on this page, you may have to use the **Save As…** menu item in
the **File** menu to save your document. If you attempt to save a document and
see this message:

![alert window][save-save-as-required]

Or this message:

![alert window][save-save-warning]

…then you can be sure that *Balthisar Tidy* is set to ensure against any
possible data loss as a result of its work.

Data loss is very unlikely, but as Tidy is very, very strict it’s possible that
it will remove content that it thinks is garbage. For this reason it’s always
important to [review the Tidy Messages table][docwin-messages].
