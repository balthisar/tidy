==============================

The **Tidy** Preferences panel works as described in
[How do I work with the Tidy Options Panel?][options_index]

![tidy prefs panel][all-tidy-prefs-Tidy]

The Preferences window can be re-sized when looking at this page, which should
provide plenty of space for working with the Tidy options.

The Tidy options set in this pane will be preset whenever you create a new
document or open an existing document.

These settings are also the settings that will be used when using one of
the [System Services][service] or [Action Extensions][extension].

<% if target_feature?(:feature_supports_applescript) %>
These are also the settings that _<%= product_name %>_ will use when using
AppleScript to Tidy files.
