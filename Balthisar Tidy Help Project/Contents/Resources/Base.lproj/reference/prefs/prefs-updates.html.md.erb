==============================

The **Updates** Preferences panel helps you control if and when automatic
software update checks are performed, as well as allows you to control what
sort of statistical information that _Balthisar Tidy_ sends when it performs
a check for updates.

![tidy prefs panel][tidy-prefs-06]

_Balthisar Tidy_ is able to update itself to new versions directly from
www.balthisar.com, if you allow it.

Additionally _Balthisar Tidy_ requests your permission to collect anonymous
system information during update checks. This information is used to help
balthisar.com target its development resources. The information is truly
anonymous and you can read about what is collected
[here](https://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle/wiki/system-profiling).
