==============================

The **Updates** Preferences panel helps you control if and when automatic
software update checks are performed, as well as allows you to control what sort
of statistical information that _<%= product_name %>_ sends when it performs a
check for updates.

![tidy prefs panel][all-tidy-prefs-Updates]

_<%= product_name %>_ is able to update itself to new versions directly from
**balthisar.com**, if you allow it.

Additionally _<%= product_name %>_ requests your permission to collect anonymous
system information during update checks. This information is used to help
balthisar.com target its development resources. The information is truly
anonymous and you can read about what is collected
[here](http://sparkle-project.org/documentation/system-profiling).
