==============================

The **Source HTML** panel is where you see and (if wanted) edit the
original file. When you open a file, its text will be present in this panel.

![source html][docpart-source]

Alternatively you can [create a blank document][doc-create] and begin adding
HTML markup in this area directly.

It’s often convenient to make quick-and-dirty, valid HTML documents
by typing directly into this window without opening documents. We don’t
recommend making this your primary HTML document editor, however, as
there are many full-featured editors more adequate for working with text.
