==============================

The **Source HTML** panel is where you see and (if wanted) edit the
original file. When you open a file, its text will be present in this panel.

![source html][docpart-source]

Alternatively you can [create a blank document][doc-create] and begin adding
HTML markup in this area directly.

It’s often convenient to make quick-and-dirty, valid HTML documents
by typing directly into this window without opening documents. We don’t
recommend making this your primary HTML document editor, however, as
there are many full-featured editors more adequate for working with text.

Drag and Drop
-------------

You can drag and drop files from Finder, as well as blocks of text from other
applications, into the Source HTML panel.

Note that when dragging files into the Source HTML pane, you are _not_ opening
that file. You are merely copying the contents of that file into the current
document.

Eligible file types for dragging are slightly different depending on the version
of Mac OS X that you are using.

### Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and above

When dragging files into the Source HTML panel, you should expect that
_<%= product_name %>_ is going to try its very best to add the contents of the
file to you document, in whatever textual format that it can. Even some image
files can be added (in their textual form), which is probably not what you
expect.

Files whose contents cannot be added will paste in the filename, instead.

### Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and below

Generally only the contents of text files that are in UTF character encoding
will have their contents dropped into the Source HTML panel.

Files whose contents cannot be added will paste in the filename, instead.
