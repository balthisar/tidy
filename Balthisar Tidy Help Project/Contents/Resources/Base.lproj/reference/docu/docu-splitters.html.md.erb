==============================

Splitters provide additional options for making _<%= product_name %>_’s document
window work according to your tastes. We’ve taken steps to mentioning them in
this reference work because they’re not an obvious feature, due to the splitters
being impossible to see. Your mouse cursor will change shape
when it passes over one of the splitters.

<div class="image_article narrow" markdown="1">
<div markdown="span">![left-right cursor][all-cursor-splitter-leftright]</div>
When the cursor changes to this shape, you can resize the panels to the
left and right of the splitter.
</div>

<div class="image_article narrow" markdown="1">
<div markdown="span">![up-down cursor][all-cursor-splitter-updown]</div>
When the cursor appears as such, you can resize the panels above and below the
splitter.
</div>
