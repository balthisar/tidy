==============================

_<%= product_name %>_’s source code area consists of two panels for displaying
HTML or XML source code.

The [Source HTML][docu-source-source] panel is where you see and (if wanted) edit the
original file.

The [Tidy HTML][docu-source-tidyd] panel display the results of the Tidying
operation using all of the settings that you’ve specified in the **Tidy Options**
panel.

The orientation of the entire source code area can be changed to suit your
preference, which gives you the choice to see your **HTML Source** and the
**Tidy HTML** in an over-under orientation or in a side-by-side configuration.

You can change the orientation in the **View** menu’s **Source Code** submenu.

You can also change the orientation using the toolbar’s **Orient** button.
