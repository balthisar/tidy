==============================

_Balthisar Tidy_’s result is displayed in the **Tidy HTML** pane. When you
save the document, this is the file that will be written to disk.

![tidy html][docpart-tidyd]

Because Tidy can be very strict, and because HTML standards sometimes
change, it’s a good idea to review this Tidy’d text before saving your
document. It’s possible (although unlikely) that Tidy removes something
that you don’t want removed.

Also refer to the [Saving preferences][prefs-filesaving], which offer a way to
prevent you from overwriting your original files.
