==============================

_<%= product_name %>_ uses standard Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X menus that an experienced or
novice user should find self-explanatory. The menu items’ descriptions
below are limited to the features unique to _<%= product_name %>_.

The **View** menu contains standard Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X View menu items, but also
adds some view-related menu items specific to _<%= product_name %>_.

- **Tidy Options** toggles the visibility of the **Tidy Options** pane in the
  document windows, as described in [Hide the Tidy Options][docwin-hidetidyoptions].

- **Tidy Messages** toggles the visibility of the **Tidy Messages** pane in the
  document windows, as described in [Hide the Tidy Messages Table][docwin-hidetidymessages].

- **Source Code** reveals a submenu with additional options.

    ![source code submenu][all-menu-view-sourcecode]

- **Inline Errors** controls whether or not “red squiggles” appear in the
  **Source HTML** editor to indicate Tidy Message error start positions.

- **Invisible Characters** toggles the display of marker characters to indicate
  otherwise invisible characters such as tabs, spaces, and linefeeds.

- **Gutter** toggles line number gutter in the **Source HTML** and
  **Tidy HTML** views. For very large documents, turning off line numbers
  may increase performance.
  
- **Syntax Highlighting** toggles the use of syntax highlighting in the
  **Source HTML** and **Tidy HTML** panels.

- **Vertical Source Code** toggles the source area between over-under and
  side-by-side views of **Source HTML** and **Tidy HTML**.
