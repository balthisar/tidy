First, make sure you have an HTML file that you would like to Tidy. If you don’t
have a file, then feel free to copy the text below, and you	can paste it into
Tidy when we get started.

~~~~~ html
<h1>Hello, World!</h3>
<p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
<a href="#"><div>Sometimes valid, sometimes now.</div></a>
<p>Some elements are <b>deprecated</b> in HTML, and they should
   be replaced by <i>other</i> elements.
</p>
<p>I hope that someday, <em><strong>everything</em></strong> will come
   to fruition!

In this walkthrough, we will Tidy some source HTML and you will gain a good
overview of how <%= pne %> works. Make sure that <%= pne %> is running.

1. **If you have an HTML file that you would like to Tidy**: [Open it][doc-open]
   it now from the **File** menu. If Tidy has trouble opening the file, then the
   [file encoding helper][doc-encoding] may appear in the document window.

2. **If you are going to paste the sample as described above**: An empty Tidy 
   document should already be open (if not, press ⌘N to create a new document).
   Paste the code that you copied above into the text area labeled **Source
   HTML**. You can [learn more][doc-view_edit] about this text area, too.

3. Observe the text in the area labeled **Tidy HTML**. Compare it with the text
   in the **Source HTML** area. In many cases you will see some significant
   differences. If you use the sample text above, you may be impressed at the
   well-formed result. You can [learn more][doc-view_tidyd] about this text
   area, too.

4. Take note of any messages in the area labeled **Tidy Messages.** If errors
   are found in your document, Tidy will correct most of them automatically and
   inform you about the changes here. You can [learn more][docwin-messages]
   about this message area, too.

5. Feel free to experiment with the Tidy options in the **Tidy Options** area
   of the document window, and notice how changes affect the **Tidy HTML**. You
   can learn how to understand the meaning of these options in
   [Tidy Options][docwin-chooseoptions].

6. You can preset Tidy options in <%= pne %>’s [Preferences][prefs-tidyoptions].

7. At this point you can **Save As…** your HTML document if you like. Because
   Tidy modifies your data, <%= pne %> can implement some measure of protection
   when you [save a document][doc-save].

Congratulations! You now understand the basic workflow and options that
<%= pne %> has to offer!
