==============================

_Balthisar Tidy_ isn’t just an HTML pretty-printer; it promises to make sure
your HTML is clean, error-free, and accessible. But it’s also much, much more.
_Balthisar Tidy_ is an _HTML development tool_; it can be a _learning tool_;
it’s a _diagnostic tool_; it’s a _batch processing tool_; it’s a graphical
_feature discovery tool_. And, of course, it’s an HTML pretty-printer.

How can you leverage _Balthisar Tidy_ in each of these roles?


HTML Development Tool
---------------------
Whether you’re hand-crafting your HTML in _vim_, using a static site generator
such as _middleman_, or using a commercial package such as _Dreamweaver_,
_Balthisar Tidy_ fits into your development chain prior to deployment. It will
check compliance to standards, accessibility, and capture common errors. Tidy
will normalize whitespace, sort attributes, ensure proper
declarations, and detect logic errors.

As a tool in your development chain, _Balthisar Tidy_ is perfect for adding
those finishing touches the ensure compliance to your standards prior to
deploying your code.


Learning Tool
-------------
All developers know it: code quality is just as important as, if not more
important than, the ability of the code to function. When learning to write XML
or HTML, consider using _Balthisar Tidy_ as a teaching aid. Its instant feedback
will reinforce rules, style, and syntax that all good developers adhere to.


Diagnostic Tool
---------------
“Tidy” doesn’t merely imply code formatting; it also means helping you eliminate
bad stuff. Things like errors, logical inconsistencies, and deprecated language
and syntax. _Balthisar Tidy_ gives you a much needed sanity check before you
ship.


Feature Discovery Tool
----------------------
Tidy has a long history in the command line world. It also has dozens of option
settings and inconsistent descriptions of what they do. Trial and error in the
command line world can be a frustrating experience.

_Balthisar Tidy_, though, offers all of Tidy’s options in an efficient, easy-to-use
GUI that provides instant Tidy-ing and instant feedback. If you don’t have the
patience to read dry specifications, simply use _Balthisar Tidy_ to discover the
features that you want.


Batch Processing Tool
---------------------
Command line Tidy can be used in shell scripts, and using _Balthisar Tidy_ as
a feature discovery tool makes it easy to decide on the settings that you want
to use with command line Tidy.

If you’re lucky enough to have _Balthisar Tidy for Work_, then you also have the
ability to generate a configuration file for command line Tidy directly from
_Balthisar Tidy_!

Finally as a _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ user, you appreciate the better things in
life and can skip shell scripts altogether. AppleScript support enables high-level
scripting, automation, and interoperability with other Macintosh applications.
With AppleScript you can batch process entire folder hierarchies, or even use
Folder Actions to Tidy files automatically.


HTML Pretty-Printer
-------------------
And of course, _Balthisar Tidy_ provides the same pretty-printing features that
Tidy has been known for for years.
