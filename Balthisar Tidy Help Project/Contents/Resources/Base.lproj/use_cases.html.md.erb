==============================

_<%= product_name %>_ isn’t just an HTML pretty-printer; it promises to make sure
your HTML is clean, error-free, and accessible. But it’s also much, much more.
_<%= product_name %>_ is an _HTML development tool_; it can be a _learning tool_;
it’s a _diagnostic tool_; it’s a _batch processing tool_; it’s a graphical
_feature discovery tool_. And, of course, it’s an _HTML pretty-printer_.

How can you leverage _<%= product_name %>_ in each of these roles?


HTML Development Tool
---------------------
Whether you’re hand-crafting your HTML in _vim_, using a static site generator
such as _middleman_, or using a commercial package such as _Dreamweaver_,
_<%= product_name %>_ fits into your development chain prior to deployment. It will
check compliance to standards, accessibility, and capture common errors. Tidy
will normalize whitespace, sort attributes, ensure proper
declarations, and detect logic errors.

As a tool in your development chain, _<%= product_name %>_ is perfect for adding
those finishing touches that ensure compliance to your standards prior to
deploying your code.


Learning Tool
-------------
All developers know it: code quality is just as important as the ability of the
code to function. When learning to write XML or HTML, consider using
_<%= product_name %>_ as a teaching aid. Its instant feedback will reinforce
rules, style, and syntax that all good developers adhere to.


Diagnostic Tool
---------------
“Tidy” doesn’t merely imply code formatting; it also means helping you eliminate
bad stuff. Things like errors, logical inconsistencies, and deprecated language
and syntax. _<%= product_name %>_ gives you a much needed sanity check before you
ship.


Feature Discovery Tool
----------------------
Tidy has a long history in the command line world. It also has dozens of option
settings and inconsistent descriptions of what they do. Trial and error in the
command line world can be a frustrating experience.

_<%= product_name %>_, though, offers all of Tidy’s options in an efficient, easy-to-use
GUI that provides instant Tidy’ing and instant feedback. If you don’t have the
patience to read dry specifications, simply use _<%= product_name %>_ to discover the
features that you want.


Batch Processing Tool
---------------------
Command line Tidy can be used in shell scripts, and using _<%= product_name %>_ as
a feature discovery tool makes it easy to decide on the settings that you want
to use with command line Tidy.

If you’re lucky enough to have _Balthisar Tidy for Work_, then you also have the
ability to generate a configuration file for command line Tidy directly from
_Balthisar Tidy for Work_.

Finally as a _Balthisar Tidy for Work_ user, you appreciate the better things in
life and can skip shell scripts altogether. AppleScript support enables
high-level scripting, automation, and interoperability with other Macintosh
applications. With AppleScript you can batch process entire folder hierarchies,
or even use Folder Actions in Finder to Tidy files automatically.


HTML Pretty-Printer
-------------------
And of course, _<%= product_name %>_ provides the same pretty-printing features that
Tidy has been known for for years.
