Messages relating to document validation are available to you in the
**W3C Validator** table. You can choose to see validator messages from either
your **Source HTML** or the **Tidy HTML**.

Follow these steps to become acquainted with the **W3C Validator** table.

1. Ensure that the tab **W3C Validator** is selected in the panel at the bottom
   of the document window.
   
2. If necessary, refresh the validator results using the ⟳ button at the bottom
   of the **W3C Validator Panel**.
   
   The indicator to the right of this button should be green to indicate that
   the validator is online and reachable.

3. Observe the messages table, which consists of one or more rows of information
   indicating data about your document.
   ![messages](all-docpart-validator)

4. Each row will contain a **Severity**, a **Location**, and a **Message
   Description**, as [described in the reference][docu-validator].

5. Clicking on a row that contains a location will move the **Source HTML** or
   the **Tidy HTML** view to the location of the error, depending on whether the
   validator table is currently set to **Show Source Results** or
   **Show Tidy Results**.
   
6. If you are only interested in certain types of messages, you can enable a
   [message type filter][docu-validator] in the Action menu at the bottom of the
   **Tidy Messages** panel.
