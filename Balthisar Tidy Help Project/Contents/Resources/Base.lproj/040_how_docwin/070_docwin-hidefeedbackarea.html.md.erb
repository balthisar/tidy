<%= md_links %>

<%= pne %> has a very configurable display. To hide (or show) the Feedback
Panel, follow the steps below.

1. Select **Feedback Panel** from the **View** menu. If the panel is currently
   visible you will see that is is checked.
   ![view menu](all-menu-view){: .menu_dropshadow}

2. You can confirm that the menu item is now unchecked and the feedback panel
   is hidden.

3. You can also easily toggle the visibility of the **Feedback Panel** using the
   **Feedback** button on the document windowâ€™s toolbar.
   ![toolbar](all-docpart-toolbar)

When you hide the Feedback Panel, any indicator icons present in the gutters of
the **Source HTML** and/or **Tidy HTML** panels will be hidden as well, in order
to ensure consistency of the interface and to provide you a distraction-free
working environment.
