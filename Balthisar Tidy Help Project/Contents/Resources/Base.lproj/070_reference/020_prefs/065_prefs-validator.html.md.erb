The **Validator** Preferences panel These preferences determine how <%= pne %>
provides document validation using a World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”) 
validator.

![tidy prefs panel validator](all-tidy-prefs-Validator){: .dropshadow}

Preferences Descriptions
------------------------

<%= pne %> offers three main options for choosing a W3C Validator to use for
validating your document. Choosing any of the options reveals further options
(described below) specific to the validator that you choose.

| **Use Balthisar Tidy’s built-in validator service** | The local copy of the Nu Validator will run on this computer as a web server, and no internet connection is necessary. Whenever this option is selected, this service is available on the port you specify to other applications, too.
| **Use the online W3C Nu Validator service**         | The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) offers an online validation service as well. It may be more up to date than Balthisar Tidy’s built-in service.
| **Specify a URL offering the Nu Validator service** | Alternate Nu Validator services are available online, or may be available on your network or locally. You can specify the complete URL here.


Reveal any of the tasks below for information about configuring the desired
validator.

<% helpbook_task 'validator-builtin', 'Use Balthisar Tidy’s built-in validator service' do %>

<%= pne %> includes its own, built-in version of the W3C’s _Nu HTML Checker_,
and its chief benefit is speed. It can perform automatic validation once per
second, so that while live editing your HTML document, you will always be aware
of the current validation status of your document.

![tidy prefs panel validator built in](all-tidy-prefs-Validator-builtin)

| **Port**          | Specify the local port on your computer to use for running the validator service.
| **Auto validate** | Choose this option to automatically validate your source and Tidy’d documents at the interval in seconds specified below.
| **Interval**      | Indicate the desired auto validation frequency.

When this preference is selected and <%= pne %> is running, a full-fledged
server is available on your computer, and possibly your network. You can use 
<%= pne %> to offer validation service to _other_ computers on your network, 
and you can even use a web browser to view the web server.

When you first choose this option, the indicator bubble will be yellow, which is
an indication that the server is starting up. Upon startup, it will turn green.
If the port is in use by another service, or if the service cannot otherwise
start, then the indicator will turn red.

<% end %>


<% helpbook_task 'validator-w3c', 'Use the online W3C Nu Validator service' do %>

Although the built-in validator is fast and can perform automatic validation at
a much faster frequency, the _W3C Markup Validation Service_ used when this
validator is selected is kept up to date faster than we can update <%= pne %>.
Thus bug fixes and adopting new HTML standards can happen much more quickly
when using this validator.

The downside, however, is that automatic validation is limited to once per 60
seconds, so that we don’t abuse the W3C’s server.

![tidy prefs panel validator w3c](all-tidy-prefs-Validator-w3c)

| **Auto validate** | Choose this option to automatically validate your source and Tidy’d documents at the interval in seconds specified below.
| **Interval**      | Indicate the desired auto validation frequency.

<% end %>


<% helpbook_task 'validator-custom', 'Specify a URL offering the Nu Validator service' do %>

Other _Nu HTML Checker_ services exist, too, or you may run one locally on your
computer, or elsewhere on your network. If you prefer to use one of these other
servers, then it can be configured here when this option is selected.

If you are using a public server, try to limit automatic validation requests so
that you do not abuse the service. The quickest that you can auto validate with
this setting is 10 seconds.

![tidy prefs panel validator custom](all-tidy-prefs-Validator-custom)

| **URL**           | Specify the complete URL of the _Nu HTML Checker_ service that should be used to perform document validation.
| **Auto validate** | Choose this option to automatically validate your source and Tidy’d documents at the interval in seconds specified below.
| **Interval**      | Indicate the desired auto validation frequency.
