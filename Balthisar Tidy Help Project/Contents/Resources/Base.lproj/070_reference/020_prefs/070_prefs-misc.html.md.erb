Preferences Descriptions
------------------------

| **Disable Mac text substitutions**             | Turns off macOS text substitutions within the Source HTML editor by default. This is recommended because otherwise it will be impossible to type some characters correctly. These can be selectively re-enabled in the Substitutions menu.
| **Use the input-encoding Helper if necessary** | The input-encoding helper normally appears when a freshly-opened document does not appear to result in any source HTML, usually as a result of character encoding issues.
| **Show the Quick Tutorial on next launch**     | When Balthisar Tidy is launched for new users, a series of helpful panels provide basic instruction. Tick this option to show the Tutorial next time you start Tidy or open a document.
| **Reduce Animation**                           | Balthisar Tidy animates certain interface elements when you activate them, and this can be distracting for some users. If you prefer to limit the amount of animation, then select this option.
| **Browser Preview Throttle**                   | The live preview can become sluggish to respond when editing large documents. Use this preference to set the number of seconds between live preview updates.
