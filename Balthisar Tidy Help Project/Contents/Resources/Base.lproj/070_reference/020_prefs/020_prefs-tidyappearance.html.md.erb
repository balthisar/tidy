Preferences Descriptions
------------------------

| **Show Tidy options in groups**                  | If selected all of Tidy’s options will be grouped by option type. Otherwise they will be ungrouped in alphabetical order.
| **Show friendly Tidy option names**              | Friendly option names can be more descriptive than the Unix Tidy option names. If you’re used to standard Tidy, traditional Tidy option names can be seen when this option is off.
| **Show the description for Tidy options**        | If selected the description panel for Tidy options will be hidden by default. It’s always available by selecting its button.
| **Show alternating row colors for Tidy options** | Alternating row colors change the background color of subsequent rows in order to help you distinguish between them. This option applies application-wide.
| **Use hovering behavior for Tidy options**       | Hovering behavior, when turned on, displays only text without the normal controls in the Tidy options panels, resulting in a more pleasant appearance. Turn this option off if you prefer a more traditional experience. This option applies application-wide.
