<%= pne %>’s source code area consists of two panels for displaying HTML or XML
source code.

The [Source HTML][docu-source-source] panel is where you see and (if wanted)
edit the original file.

![source html](all-docpart-source)


The [Tidy HTML][docu-source-tidyd] panel display the results of the Tidy’ing
operation using all of the settings that you’ve specified in the **Tidy Options**
panel.

![source html](all-docpart-tidyd)

The orientation of the entire source code area can be changed to suit your
preference, which gives you the choice to see your **HTML Source** and the
**Tidy HTML** in an over-under orientation or in a side-by-side configuration.

You can change the orientation in the **View** menu’s **Source Code** submenu.
![view menu](all-menu-view){: .menu_dropshadow}
![view submenu](all-menu-view-sourcecode){: .menu_dropshadow}

You can also change the orientation using the toolbar’s **Orient** button.
![toolbar](all-docpart-toolbar)
