Balthisar Tidy Operation Logic
==============================

###Opening Document

* When opening a document, if the data > 0 but there's no string, tell the user that the the file
  couldn't be decoded, and warn that the display might be blank. User should select new encoding
  before modifying blank document.

###Guessing Encoding

* Try stringWithContentsOfFile:usedEncoding:error: or initWithContentsOfFile:usedEncoding:error: (or the URL-based equivalents).

* Otherwise, try to interpret it as UTF-8. You can do this by calling initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding
  and checking if the result is non-nil.

* If that fails, use a default 8-bit encoding, such as -[NSString defaultCStringEncoding] (which provides
  a locale-appropriate guess).

* Note that once you get to MacOSRoman, you can stop checking any others, because MacOSRoman will successfully
  (if not necessarily correctly) decode any sequence of bytes you throw at it.
