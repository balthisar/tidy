About
-----

_Balthisar Tidy_ will clean and pretty-print format your HTML code.

- Eliminate superfluous crud from HTML generator applications such as word processors
- Fix and/or remove document errors
- Pretty-print (nicely format) your HTML code for maximum human legibility

Unlike the Tidy service offered by many Mac OS X text editors, _Balthisar Tidy_ gives you full control over all of Tidy’s formatting, cleanup, error-detection, and other options, and it’s all available in a highly-useful, native Mac OS X application.
