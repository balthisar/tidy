# being that one of the design goals is to use TidyLib intact, we're going to define options here that have datatypes
# that are IN CONTRARY to how they are defined in TidyLib's config.c definitions. We COULD simplify matters and
# change the config.c, but purity dictates otherwise. Items listed here will be processed as STRINGS
#
# doctype takes a string for a user-specified string. Use doctype-mode for the picklist.
doctype
# the new-*-tags options have YES/NO picklists -- I don't know why. They're strings of comma-separated
# values used for teaching Tidy about new tags. Null should automatically mean NO
new-inline-tags
new-blocklevel-tags
